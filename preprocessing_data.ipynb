So we stood there waiting as 3 of them were at the counter sorting through whatever they needed to sort out which was fine. After a few mins a couple came in after us and walked by us to the counter and asked for 2 seats. The same girl who told us to wait, wrote down their names and still didn’t address us. After another 5 mins we finally got approached for our names and then they seated the couple, who came after us, first as we continued to wait to be seated. That’s a big strike one in my books. It’s not like they were extremely busy and there were 4 tables for 2 cleaned and available. I’ve been to the downtown Toronto location many times and it's probably one of the best ramen shops I’ve been to in Canada. The ramen at this location did not meet the same expectation. We ordered the Miso Black and the noodles and cha-shu were sub par. The kitchen looked crowded with 5 people working but was not efficient. The person boiling the noodles looked like a high school student. I think the place just needs some time before they get into the right pace and rhythm but as it is now, there are much better options for good food in that area and in that price range.\"]\n",

To be fair we didn't make a reservation but their estimate of the wait time was under by maybe 15 minutes so prepare to wait, I'd say, even with a reservation because they can only accommodate so many people. Small selection of ramen but I guess that's what you expect at a ramen place. Since they just opened they don't have their liquor license yet so no alcohol (as of 23rd of June anyways). Unlike the sansotei at dundas and yonge they don't offer different broths unfortunately and I found the broth to be just a tad overseasoned as most ramen broths tend to be. We also got the gyoza which was to be honest the lowest part of the meal; it wasn't that good. Given that it's relatively new the whole feel was nice: new chairs, new tables, new bowls and utensils, but that's just me and it's not like people haven't touched what I was using or the seat I was sitting in... I guess it's psychological.\"]\n",

I've been to the local Kenzo for many years, and have given up many times because of the ridiculous wait. Glad this small place is here, just inside the vestibule for Door 9 @ Sq1, between Walmart & Simons. Tonkotsu Comparisons: Broth ... It's Sansotei by a Korean cold buckwheat noodle mile, even though I always greedily finish every last drop of Kenzo broth of my and my children's bowls; Noodles ... Sansotei for its preferable toothy texture and choice of thin or thick noodles; Charsu ... Kenzo for its pure porkiness eaten with the minced garlic garnish; Egg ... Sansotei as 2 halves are better than 1; vegetables ... it's black fungus at this place vs. Shanghai bokchoy for Kenzo.  Went in at 2pm on a weekday in the middle of a heatwave!! AC wasn't functioning well that day.  I love my ramen. My experience of service was friendly, efficient & helpful. Haven't tried the Mississauga Kinton yet ... I tried but the lineup turned me off, after trying to find paid street parking.\"]\n",

Stick to the ramen places in the east end / downtown, this place isn't up to par with the others. Am dissapointed that there is still no great ramen place in sauga. Problems may be due to new staff, but no management seemed to be present trying to run the business as it should for a new place. Also they don't have the proper soup takeout containers for noodles (isn't this a noodle place?!?)... only had small styrofoam boxes.\"]\n",

The Zangi was a good price of only $4.  (I intentionally ordered the Zangi side dish because from the first experience, I thought I would receive a skimpy portion of noodles). When I walked in, I was a bit annoyed the server was going to squish me into a small obscure corner table where I would've had a difficult time getting into the seat without bumping into the customer that was sitting at the table over.  I immediately asked for a different table. Will leave the rating at three stars for now... I ordered the Tonkatsu Black.  I added an egg not realizing an egg already came with it. Small serving, so quite pricy for the size., Only two small slices of pork, very little toppings. Good flavour though, I tried to drink all the broth.  Was very thirsty after.  Very nice cozy resto, and very good service and fast.  Only the mango cheesecake was available today, but more dessert selections will be added to the menu eventually.  Still like Kenzo Ramen the best. The three star is for the small serving to high price ratio.\"]\n",

All ramen bowls come with a soft boiled egg which is nice because other restos have additional charge for the egg. I think they can improve on a couple of things: For one, the serving size is small. Also, they need to improve on how they seat their customers. Because once the table becomes available, they need to call for the person next in line instead of just waiting for the customers to keep checking in if their table is already available. Maybe follow how Kenzo and Kinton Ramen do it. Lastly, (and maybe this is just me because I have a sensitive sense of smell), they need to have a more sanitized way in cleaning their tables and glasses because during our visit, it really smelled like dirty rag.

The waitress apologized and got a mop to also clean up the place offering paper towels, but the damage control wasn't enough. Water was spilled inside of her purse and her bottoms were wet. Our original waitress was so embarrassed that she switched to a different waiter to serve our table instead. Now, the manager who I presumably believe is a man with a cap with his arms crossed in the kitchen doing nothing but overlooking the entire restaurant and witnessed the entire situation, did absolutely NOTHING to help the situation. At the very end, we received the bill like a normal guest would. The least of my expectation is some sort of recognition of a fault made by their service team whether that be a discount off bill, one meal off, or I would've even accepted their future offer of a discount later. All of which damage control methods were not considered and I'm truly disappointed that they would've think that essentially ignoring an incident that happened, is a valid action of its own.

The portions are a little small for the price, but overall the ramen is good. I went to Sansotei the other day and they got my order wrong. It was no big deal, so I notified the server. I wasn't angry at all, and I didn't wanna seem picky, but I told her that they gave me the wrong noodles (I ordered thin, but got thick) The server said that the kitchen must have confused it, and said sorry, THEN WALKED AWAY. Like???? I'm sorry, are you not gonna fix my order? Regardless if thick vs. thin noodles aren't a big deal, I want what I ordered. While she was in the area of my table, I called her again and asked her to kindly fix my order. She asked me what I wanted them to do about it. She obviously didn't want to fix my order, and kept delaying on getting a new bowl for me. It was around 7:20, maybe close to closing? But I shouldn't have to eat what I didn't order, just because it would be inconvenient for them. I ended up getting a new bowl, but the whole incident was very irritating. If my order is wrong, you fix it. No question about it. I can't believe she didn't offer a replacement in the beginning. I had to ASK FOR A REPLACEMENT. At the end of it, I paid full price. At that point, I was over the whole ordeal, but compensation for their mistake would have been nice. Even a small discount, I would have appreciated. I definitely won't be back after this.\"]\n",

Located next to Exit 9 (near Dollarama), it has it's own separate location without needing to browse through the mall. Their ramen is inspired off of the Kyushu and Hokkaido regions of Japan so their broth may be different from other ramen places. (Different regions have a different broth thickness, density and style). With 6 different ramen choices and thick or thin noodles to choose from, there's a bit for everyone! I personally love the Tomato Ramen that comes with Chashu (Pork), Hokkaido Scallop, Egg, Tomato and Shiitake Mushrooms). I've been here several times and it's been consistent from day one the restaurant opened in 2018. Even during, pre- and post-pandemic, the food quality is still consistent! Staff is pretty responsive and they do a great job with cycling customers and cleaning tables immediately after! At one point, they even signed up for the Yelp Waitlist as well - but they also can put your name down on a waitlist. Either way, they're pretty good at turnaround and service. When waiting for take-out orders or waiting for a table, they have a big area (still within the mall) that you can wait outside. It's spaced out and roomy and doesn't block the main entrance or blocking service. They prefer customers to wait outside which is better than inside as they have limited space.\"]\n",
