1;Tiffany Choi;16/06/18;5;4;This cozy restaurant seats about 35 guests, is brightly-lit, and has a moderate noise level. Sansotei hasn't had its grand opening yet, but the servers are very well-trained, and the operations seem to run smoothly. It was organized, with a waitlist for tables, and accurate estimates of the wait time. We received our food soon after ordering, and it was delicious!
2;michael Bui;20/06/18;5;4;For Mississauga, this is the best you'll get and closest to the real deal. The staff was extremely generous and welcoming. I had ordered the Tonkotsu Black which was extremely rich in flavour but not overly shadowed by salt (which most ramen shops mistakenly do most of the time).   The pork is extremely tender and the yolk of the eggs are always exactly what you'd expect....runny and delicious.
3;Lauren Bourque;21/06/18;5;0;Great Tonkotsu, a good rival for Kenzo for top Mississauga shop (not that we have alot of ramen places outside of toronto yet.) can't wait to try their Gyoza and Gyudon to
4;Anthony Luo;21/06/18;3;0;The soup was a bit saltier than we had expected. Will probably come back after things have settled down and they have their official grand opening.
5;Jessica Chan;22/06/18;5;2;Very nice decor with parking lot in front (Entrance no. 9). Great value too! One of my favourite ramen restaurants.
6;Terry Wright;22/06/18;5;1;This place is so good for ramen. Owned by 2 friendly brothers, great service, hot fresh noodles, excellent flavor. Really impressed with the menu choices, interior styling is so cool too! I'll definitely be coming here whenever I'm at the mall. Thanks for the amazing experience!
7;Jen Ho;24/06/18;4;0;I had the Tonkotsu ramen and my buddy had the shrimp one.  The shrimp takes an extra 10 to 15 minutes to cook the shrimp (??? shrimp cooks fast but ok). It's a very small place, so be prepared to wait.  We put our name down and came back 40 minutes later (initially told 30) and were relieved to find out our table didn't come up yet. Service is good and they all said bye to us on the way out (thumbs up)
8;Swonlis W;25/06/18;4;0;Ramen was good, service was good, but the broth was too salty.
9;Curtis Li;25/06/18;2;3;Good service, but the broth was quite salty, and the meat had a weird taste, I’m not sure if that’s the style of the restaurant, but I’m not really a fan.
11;T H;26/06/18;1;3;Went with a friend and there was no line up which was nice. As we entered, one of the staff said to give her a minute and she’ll get to us. So we stood there waiting as 3 of them were at the counter sorting through whatever they needed to sort out which was fine. After a few mins a couple came in after us and walked by us to the counter and asked for 2 seats. The same girl who told us to wait, wrote down their names and still didn’t address us. After another 5 mins we finally got approached for our names and then they seated the couple, who came after us, first as we continued to wait to be seated. That’s a big strike one in my books. It’s not like they were extremely busy and there were 4 tables for 2 cleaned and available. I’ve been to the downtown Toronto location many times and it's probably one of the best ramen shops I’ve been to in Canada. The ramen at this location did not meet the same expectation. We ordered the Miso Black and the noodles and cha-shu were sub par. The kitchen looked crowded with 5 people working but was not efficient. The person boiling the noodles looked like a high school student. I think the place just needs some time before they get into the right pace and rhythm but as it is now, there are much better options for good food in that area and in that price range.
12;M J;26/06/18;3;0;"Service was good overall but it was extremely difficult to get a table. To be fair we didn't make a reservation but their estimate of the wait time was under by maybe 15 minutes so prepare to wait, I'd say, even with a reservation because they can only accommodate so many people. Small selection of ramen but I guess that's what you expect at a ramen place. Since they just opened they don't have their liquor license yet so no alcohol (as of 23rd of June anyways). Unlike the sansotei at dundas and yonge they don't offer different broths unfortunately and I found the broth to be just a tad overseasoned as most ramen broths tend to be. We also got the gyoza which was to be honest the lowest part of the meal; it wasn't that good. Given that it's relatively new the whole feel was nice: new chairs, new tables, new bowls and utensils, but that's just me and it's not like people haven't touched what I was using or the seat I was sitting in... I guess it's psychological."
13;Ryan Cane;27/06/18;5;2;Great service and nice looking place. Very generous serving of authentic Japanese ramen. Delicious and attractive plating. Edible orchids are rare, nice to see them in my bowl. Can’t wait to go back!!!!! One recommendation is to serve a good Japanese beer.
14;Karen Zhao;29/06/18;5;1;I'll make this easy: The tonkotsu broth is amazing. You will get addicted. I didn't get the mango cheesecake but the customer next to me stated the only mango flavor is from the two small mango pieces.
16;Miguel Jiang;02/07/18;5;0;Great service, plus I really like the food
17;C Jay;07/07/18;5;1;"No line ups ... yet!!  Been to the locations in downtown Toronto & Ottawa where there's always a line. Must be because of the weather and the word hasn't got out that Sansotei has arrived in Mississauga!! I had the Tonkotsu with thin noodles. Love this place for their creamy, superbly prepared and flavour packed broth, and you get both halves of a perfectly cooked egg. Charsu is tasty too. I've been to the local Kenzo for many years, and have given up many times because of the ridiculous wait. Glad this small place is here, just inside the vestibule for Door 9 @ Sq1, between Walmart & Simons. Tonkotsu Comparisons: Broth ... It's Sansotei by a Korean cold buckwheat noodle mile, even though I always greedily finish every last drop of Kenzo broth of my and my children's bowls; Noodles ... Sansotei for its preferable toothy texture and choice of thin or thick noodles; Charsu ... Kenzo for its pure porkiness eaten with the minced garlic garnish; Egg ... Sansotei as 2 halves are better than 1; vegetables ... it's black fungus at this place vs. Shanghai bokchoy for Kenzo.  Went in at 2pm on a weekday in the middle of a heatwave!! AC wasn't functioning well that day.  I love my ramen. My experience of service was friendly, efficient & helpful. Haven't tried the Mississauga Kinton yet ... I tried but the lineup turned me off, after trying to find paid street parking."
18;Harry Sakata;08/07/18;5;0;Very clean restaurant with delicious food and friendly service. Their zangi is especially amazing!
19;Kevin Chow;08/07/18;1;2;Will not come back. Bad service / management and really slow kitchen (you can watch through the window yourself). Longer than usual wait times made worse by bad line management (came Sunday around 2pm). The experience ruined what otherwise was an okay ramen bowl, slightly too salty though. Stick to the ramen places in the east end / downtown, this place isn't up to par with the others. Am dissapointed that there is still no great ramen place in sauga. Problems may be due to new staff, but no management seemed to be present trying to run the business as it should for a new place. Also they don't have the proper soup takeout containers for noodles (isn't this a noodle place?!?)... only had small styrofoam boxes.
20;He Siya;10/07/18;4;0;Finally got Sansotei in Mississauga!! The ramen is a little bit salty but tasty. The new location’s environment is great, decoration is good.
22;Regina Wong;11/07/18;3;0;I went back for a second time today and ordered the Tomato Ramen and a side of Zangi.  The portions were better today, where I received a decent amount of noodles (first time I walked out hungry due to the fact that my bowl of ramen barely had any noodles).  The Zangi was a good price of only $4.  (I intentionally ordered the Zangi side dish because from the first experience, I thought I would receive a skimpy portion of noodles). When I walked in, I was a bit annoyed the server was going to squish me into a small obscure corner table where I would've had a difficult time getting into the seat without bumping into the customer that was sitting at the table over.  I immediately asked for a different table. Will leave the rating at three stars for now... I ordered the Tonkatsu Black.  I added an egg not realizing an egg already came with it. Small serving, so quite pricy for the size., Only two small slices of pork, very little toppings. Good flavour though, I tried to drink all the broth.  Was very thirsty after.  Very nice cozy resto, and very good service and fast.  Only the mango cheesecake was available today, but more dessert selections will be added to the menu eventually.  Still like Kenzo Ramen the best. The three star is for the small serving to high price ratio.
23;Joanna Viv;12/07/18;1;1;I regret spending my money on this Ramen. I would forgive the tight space but the food was just bad. 🤮 Noodles remained hard tastes like plastic (which we asked if they are made fresh, and were told they are, why lie). The broth tasted so artificial. The pork toppings was so chewy, dry and not fresh. If this is the first Ramen I tasted in my whole life I would probably not eat any kind of Ramen again. As soon as you look at the kitchen staff you can see they’re noobs. I don’t know how the owners approved the taste. Maybe they should go and learn from Kenzo ramen in Mississauga. (Specifically the one in Mississauga). We simply couldn’t finish eating it
24;Ricky Lo;12/07/18;5;0;Great service and the ramen is on par with other locations. Best ramen place in Mississauga so far!
25;Kevin Ko;13/07/18;4;0;Went with my family at 6:50pm and only had a 10 minute wait (any later and it would get busy). We each had different ramen: Shoyu, Tomato and Tonkatsu. Noodles and broth were great, but the Shrimp in the Tomato Ramen was a bit mushy. Ramen costs about $12 to $12.75. Service was prompt and friendly.
26;Guagua FoodLover;13/07/18;2;2;(Translated by Google) Not to mention the bad food, the service is not good. There are several empty tables when waiting for a seat, and guests are not allowed to sit for a long time
27;Michael Kitazume;14/07/18;1;2;Poor food and service. I went there with a friend, it was pretty empty and the waiter brought us to a table where the seats have oil and water on it, although they apologised and cleaned it up for us, I still feel like they didn’t do their job well as the store was not crowded at that time. The ramen was expensive but the portion couldn’t even make you full, it has a weird aftertaste after you drink the broth, doesn’t worth the price. My friend ordered chicken wings but the chicken wings tasted like chinese chicken wings marinated with soy sauce, didn’t taste Japanese at all. It was my first time being to this restaurant and the waiter didn’t even know what to recommend, they recommended something wrong -the tantan ramen, in which, when I talked to my friends later on they told me the waiter should have recomented the black oil ramen. Also, they didn’t have alcohol but it was on the menu. Overall, very dissapointing experience - small serving size, poor service. The experience was so bad that I didn’t even wanna give tips.They should have learnt about the service and portion size from Kenzo Ramen.
28;Radek R;15/07/18;5;0;Ramen to beat in Mississauga. Time for Kenzo to step up their broth game. Authentic, decent portions, reasonably priced....
29;Xenia Gonzales;17/07/18;3;0;I've been a fan of Sansotei ever since I tried it. I used to trek all the way to the Markham and North York locations just to have it. I was excited to have the Square One location open, as it was close to work. The ramen is great. However, the service at the Square One location needs work! Staff aren't as attentive. I got extremely disappointed after my second visit. It wasn't even busy. I kept eyeing the waitress who took our order, as we kept waiting and waiting for our food. Finally when I caught her attention, I asked her where our ramen was, and she said she forgot to put it in and that it would be another 10 more minutes. We waited over 30 mins for ramen during 1:30-2:00pm. Non-peak hours, and certainly not busy enough to warrant this mishap.
30;St W;18/07/18;4;1;So this is close to same named Ramen resto in downtown Toronto near Dundas Square. Good broth, very similar, but slightly different menu. You have the option of thick or thin noodles and they have chicken sides not offered at the downtown location. I tried the slow cooked chicken., which seems to be marinated then bbq'ed and out in a slow cooker. It came out very tender and very different than the usual chicken karage offered in most ramen places. Table service was good but the wait for food was a fairly long and there weren't a lot of patrons. Since the mall is so big I called for their closest big box store so I wouldn't have to walk all over the mall. It is near entrance 8 which is the one closest to Walmart on the north side.
32;Todd;23/07/18;5;0;I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the spicy Ramen and the fried chicken (I forget the menu names). Service was good but it was a Monday afternoon and not too busy. Next time I am at square one I will go again.
35;Alan Bach;29/07/18;4;0;"Decent ramen, not good enough for me to crave; as I will still venture downtown for my ramen cravings but very respectable as a local Mississauga ramen location. Service is on point, fairly nice looking decor however the seating, walkway and overall space is very limited. Sitting at a tables along wall, the servers are already having difficulty bringing the bowls to the table due to narrow paths between the rows. I would imagine in winter when winter jackets are hung behind seats and when the floors are wet this will be an issue. Small nitpicking or head-ups, any ramen extras will be served in the ramen bowl. So if you wish to share extra chashu (say if you do not wish to eat all the pieces) you'll have to dig through each other's bowls and having all the corn put in at once will cause the corn to sink to the bottom of the bowl."
36;David Cheng;30/07/18;4;0;Small cozy Japanese ramen place. Ramen was good, service was good but really don't enjoy their music.
37;DrS;06/08/18;1;2;(Translated by Google) There are vacant seats not allowed to sit, thinking that someone has a reservation or something. What's the point of waiting ten minutes and letting us sit in the same empty seat?
38;RONG DENG;06/08/18;1;2;There are few empty tables inside , however the waitress let us wait around 10mins by stand by the door, then , lead us straight to an available table. I can not understand the waiting for why...
39;J R;07/08/18;4;0;"Coming around here around lunch time for me is pleasant as it’s not too busy . Tonkotsu  black ramen and if you don’t like your broth to thick ask for extra broth on side ;)"
40;Jessica N;09/08/18;3;0;"Ramen is okay. Everything in the bowl seemed to be a flavour of its own; no 'marriage' of flavours. And temperature of the broth was a bit cooler than I'd preferred. Wait time was long on a Tuesday evening.Decor is nice. Non-Japanese staff still call out Japanese greetings albeit half-heartedly and timidly and not as loud as you'd expect. Kitchen staff are very young. Overall it seems like this location is still trying to get the hang of things."
41;Serena Li;16/08/18;2;0;Service was average. Food was okay. We ordered two ramens  one was the spicy one with extra noodles and one was the miso black. When the food a came my bf asked if it was extra noodles like he asked the girl said yes and then she comes back and said it wasn't so she will bring it on the side. He knew by the looks of it in the beginning that it wasn't extra noodles since he got that last time and the portion was off. Anyway she came back with the noodles and he put it in his bowl and asked her for more soup since now the bowl is full of noodles and barely any soup left. She asks the chef N he says no, she comes back saying that's the usual portion for soup even adding extra noodles. So they mess up and tried to lie in the beginning and then they couldn't just give us more soup. At the end when we were paying the extra noodles wasn't charged and my bf thought it was a gesture from them for messing up but it was actually cause the girl forgot to punch it in. She was just clueless.
42;Nicole;17/08/18;5;1;Super cute and cozy! I love the sansotei downtown and was excited when this one opened up. The food is good and the staff was extremely attentive when I visited! It is small though so be careful when bringing larger groups (>4) or during busy hours.
44;Aks S;20/08/18;3;0;We went for lunch on the weekend and surprisingly, didn't have to wait. There were a lot of open tables. Both hubby and I ordered spicy tantan ramen. It took a really long time for the food to come, specially since it wasnt so busy. The ramen was ok, I was disappointed by the portion of meat that it came with. It used to be a bigger piece, now its a thin slice of pork. This place is a bit difficult to find, through the mall as a FYI.
45;Hollies;25/08/18;5;2;The best Japanese Ramen in Mississauga. You won't be disappointed.
46;Anthony Le;25/08/18;4;0;The ramen is good, but the portion sizes are pretty small for the price. Service was great and really fast.
47;HoshinoArika;26/08/18;5;0;fantastic
48;K S;26/08/18;5;0;"I went on a Saturday afternoon at around 2 and there was a line-up of people waiting to get a table. The location is great because it's right on square one. The wait wasn't that long though; we got a table after waiting for like 10 minutes. The staff were friendly and attentive; the service was quick. The ramen was delicious. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles and asked if they could make it less salty and oily, and they did! The ramen was so much better than the other ramen places I've been to! The broth was not too salty (I didn't need to gulp down water after drinking the broth and I actually finished drinking all the broth) and it wasn't oily at all. The noodles were perfect as well. Price was cheap. Will definitely come again!"
49;Bob W;27/08/18;5;0;Ramen very rich in flavor
52;Aaron T;03/09/18;3;0;Overall great flavors. However I found the broth to be a little more on the warm side rather than hot. Price is on par with most ramen restaurants which is fair. I went on a Saturday around noon and there was a slight wait to be seated, turn over for tables happened fairly quick.
53;Charlotte Urieta;07/09/18;3;0;Let me start with the positives: They have Tantanmen - that’s the spicy ramen and not all ramen places have that, so that’s a plus. My kids ordered Tonkotsu and Shoyu- they both taste good but I think the Shoyu tasted better between the two. All ramen bowls come with a soft boiled egg which is nice because other restos have additional charge for the egg. I think they can improve on a couple of things: For one, the serving size is small. Also, they need to improve on how they seat their customers. Because once the table becomes available, they need to call for the person next in line instead of just waiting for the customers to keep checking in if their table is already available. Maybe follow how Kenzo and Kinton Ramen do it. Lastly, (and maybe this is just me because I have a sensitive sense of smell), they need to have a more sanitized way in cleaning their tables and glasses because during our visit, it really smelled like dirty rag. I had to re-wipe our table with my pocket wipes. Ending it with the fact that the server were nice and friendly.
54;J Lam;08/09/18;4;0;Quick and efficient in greeting and seating. Flavours was balanced. Miso Black was not overly salty or spicy.
55;Ben Cherian;09/09/18;4;0;Micro ramen shop. Always packed. Broth is excellent. Service is friendly and fast.
56;Nan Yi (Vivian);09/09/18;5;0;the Ramen is sooooooooo delicious. and also zangi chicken is also soooooooo delicious. I love Sansotel!
57;Prerit Ahuja;10/09/18;5;0;Always good!
58;lianne huynh;11/09/18;5;1;I've had nothing but amazing experiences every time I eat at Sansotei! The food is unlike any other ramen I've had and everyone should try the zangi because it's so addicting! The service is consistently super quick and very friendly every single time I've gone. I would come back all the time if I didn't live so far!
59;Fabian Lee Wing;16/09/18;5;0;Best ramen in Mississauga. Broth is by far the tastiest.
60;Mee O.;20/09/18;4;0;Good flavorful broth but a tad too salty. Noodles have good chew and the pork chasu was really good!
62;Chaoze Liu;27/09/18;1;2;bad service. they got empty seat but we are not allowed to seat.
63;Daniel S.;29/09/18;5;0;Love this place/chain. They have one of the best ramen broths. The only thing is there is usually a line because the place is small.Their ramens are top quality and I definitely recommend ordering a side of Zangi chicken. The peach sake is also very good.
64;A HM;02/10/18;2;2;Ramen was okay. Got the tonkotsu black because it was recommended to me as the most flavourful. To be honest, I still found it average and lacking. It was interesting that it came with an edible orchid flower. We also ordered the spicy slow cooked wings and beware that these aren't your traditional wings. They were wet and were more like chicken in a soup.. we didn't like it all. I won't be back. I think there are other ramen places out there with more flavour and more filling portions. The waiting time here can also get pretty long
65;Marck Bernal;05/10/18;4;0;Excellent ramen and customer service. I’ll suggest a pager system for long waits.
66;Ryan Saavedra;07/10/18;1;1;Place is very disorganized. I get it that there’s a line and wait times can vary based on completed tables. However, you can just tell people to wait, telling them in 10mins then all of a sudden after 10mins it becomes 30mins when clearly there are tables around.
68;Ramona Srinivasan;10/10/18;5;0;Delicious food, served in an authentic Asian ambience! The staff was thoughtful and helpful, in selecting the best dishes for me. Portions are sizeable too! I look forward to dining here soon!
69;Martin Truong;11/10/18;5;0;Better than most Ramen places in Mississauga in my opinion.
71;Lisa Yao;13/10/18;1;4;I would give 0 stars if I could. 2 of us came at 6pm today and told Sansotei we have a group of 6. They sat us down at a table for 4 and told us when the rest of us get here they can accommodate us by adding a chair or if the table beside us clears up we can take a table from there. BUT when we all got here, the server refused to give us an extra chair and said they're not able to serve a group of 6 (she said maximum a group of 5 is allowed???). Basically she told us to leave. Never come here if you expect basic human decency and integrity from a restaurant!! 😠 Management clearly did not give a damn and never showed up to explain.
72;Michelle H.;20/10/18;3;1;"To be honest, I was quite disappointed with my experience here. The portions were very small, the ""filling"" seemed sparse, and the broth was rich but too salty to enjoy. The flavors definitely aren't bad -- the pork belly and soft boiled egg are actually quite good. But if I'm paying $14+ for a bowl of ramen, I expect it to be much more satisfying. Definitely not what I remembered Sansotei in Toronto to be like. I will not be returning."
74;Phil M;21/10/18;2;1;Ramen came lukewarm, noodles weren't warm either. Bamboo shoots were almost ice cold... egg wasn't fresh either. Definitely don't recommend. However, the broth did have flavor, so that's at least a plus.
75;Fortuno Cheung;26/10/18;5;0;Good food with good service! Will visit again! But will avoid busy hours.
78;ACEagle HD;28/10/18;5;0;Fell in love with the Sansotei on Dundas downtown so I thought I’d try this one. It did not disappoint. Delicious as always.
81;J Sila;30/10/18;5;0;The food was 3.5, but the service made it 5 stars.
82;AGATHA SADEWA;30/10/18;5;0;Good food, excellent service by all the servers especially jessica. Nice addition to sq1 eatery that's been getting dull tbh
83;Adriel Firtandi;30/10/18;5;0;Tastes great!!
84;Peter T;30/10/18;5;0;Jessica is the best server ever. 11/10! A+
88;Domenic Conte;03/11/18;4;0;Limited menu with very small options.  Both food and beverages.
93;王志超;07/11/18;4;0;(Translated by Google) Okay, deduct one star, because the service is not good
95;Glen Gamo;08/11/18;5;0;Just great. And the zangi awesome
96;Nathan Lee;08/11/18;5;0;Good food, great service. The tall waitress was really nice.
100;Minne mouse;17/11/18;2;1;Expensive for too little food
101;Ricky Lie;19/11/18;1;1;The service was great and friendly, but the ramen noodles was not authentic, the broth was very salty and pork was too fatty and had weird flavour. The gyoza also didn't taste good at all .
103;Celine Gonzales;20/11/18;4;0;Had surprisingly very flavorful broth which is such a rarity into non-japanese staffed chain. They give you a lot of noodles (warning: don't order extra. I regretted it the last time). Its only a 4 because their charsiu was not great. Charsiu should be melt in your mouth, fatty and soft pork belly. Theirs was  dry and only gave you very little amount in comparison to other places so you'll definitely need to order more of it.
104;Joseph Vrian Zabala;21/11/18;3;7;We've had better ramen to be honest, I personally thought the portion was small and it left me still hungry. I had the Miso Black, broth was watery and didn't have enough meat on it. Noodles should've been plentiful. For it's price, I was left dissatisfied with the quality of food. I wish I can recommend it but this place is a pass for me.
105;tiger wu;25/11/18;4;0;Pretty tasty ramen and presentation definitely instagram worthy.
106;Therese Nazareno (Thea);25/11/18;4;0;Great food but just be prepared to wait for a long time. Seating is limited. Menu is straight to the point.
107;jordan mcbride;27/11/18;4;0;Okay priced ramen. Had one recommendsd by a friend, but it wasn't anything to write home about.
109;Andrew Y.;29/11/18;5;1;Tonkatsu black is really good
110;Darel Simpson;01/12/18;5;0;The tables were a little tightly packed, but the food was delivered super fast.  I've come to love Ramen soup places.  The noodles were nicely firm and the pork belly almost melted in my mouth.  Would go again.
118;Robert George;03/12/18;3;0;Nice little Japanese restaurant. Small menu though!
120;Vivian Liu;08/12/18;4;0;Followed the sandwich sign in the mall to this restaurant which is curiously between sets of entrance doors at Square One. A small but busy place. My order came quickly and the ramen was quite delicious, with very flavourful broth and tasty noodles and toppings. The seating is quite snug as tables of diners are almost butted up against each other, but the service is very courteous and comes with a smile. Did wish they had free Wi-Fi though, but not a huge deal.
123;Brian S;15/12/18;3;2;Overall not too bad. Only wait a few minutes. Food in general was ok. Surprised there wasn't more variety in the ramen (broth choices, noodle types..). The most points would have to go toward the ambience and presentation for sure. Still, not a place unworthy of crossing off your ramen joint list. Why not try all three in Mississauga and post your preference.
124;Mathew Salama;15/12/18;4;0;Broth was rich and good but the portion could be bigger
125;Arin Goswami;15/12/18;5;0;Best ramen in Sauga
126;reynard lopez;16/12/18;1;4;Sorry,  no better than instant noodles.  Quality is inferior specifically  when I took my first slurp of the broth.  I was expecting piping hot. It was warm and the egg was cold. 3 times I've been here thinking that it might get better.  Nope. You could really do better.
128;BubbleTea;17/12/18;5;0;Perfect 😍❤️
129;Peter V;18/12/18;5;0;Very attentive service, busy but quick.  Ran out of baboo shoots day I was there (3 hours before close) Great meal for $15
130;Feby Liemor;18/12/18;5;0;Fave food is black tonkatsu.. Nice place n customer service n of course delicious ramen.
133;Bradley Darwin;19/12/18;4;1;Delicious ramen. I ordered the Tonkatsu, along with an extra egg and some fried chicken on the side. Everything was prepared quickly. The broth had a wonderfully deep roasted pork flavor, and is well balanced. Noodles (I ordered thick) were just right, with a good bite and picked up lots of the broth. I would have loved to see more of the add-ins in the soup, but it's not like they were skimping out. The fried chicken was fine, nice and crispy, but largely forgettable. The soup alone was worth the trip though, and I'll be back again. Be prepared to wait in line to be seated.
136;LEXY LIN;23/12/18;2;5;I’d like to separate comments into 2 aspects. First, in terms of the food, the ramen is very good that is worth to try. However when speaking of service, awful service! This is the first time that we didn’t give tips to a service. We waited in line with my boyfriend’s name registered. The waitress never called us until I realized something is wrong because people who came later than us even went inside before us! So we confirmed with the receptionist. She said she called the name, but that’s not possible as none of us hear it and we were right out of the door (they required customers to wait outside). Then they offered no apology at all and kept letting later customers enter and kept us still waiting for a while. We were very unsatisfactory with this behavior and the way they treated customers.
137;Victor Victor;23/12/18;5;0;Excellent ramen. Try the fried chicken.
138;Kim Le;24/12/18;5;2;Some people tried to steal our table. The nerve of some people. The waitress was very kind and apologized to us even though we knew it wasn't their fault. The food came out quickly and was delicious. The only thing I can say needs improvement is the line system so vultures aren't able to take tables.
141;Chelsea Nguyen;27/12/18;5;0;Great ramen/side dishes and amazing service. **they have beer and sake too**
142;Stephanie Samuel;28/12/18;4;0;The ramen was pretty good,  the broth was delicious. The restaurant is quite tight, I didn't enjoy the pork, it had an odd taste. Will be back tho!
143;MICHELLE “STARMIE G” TAT;28/12/18;4;0;Taste consistent to the other sansotei's. Dont go in a big group
145;Craig D;29/12/18;5;0;Great ramen! No longer need to travel downtown. Service was excellent. Although it was a tight space they accomodated a baby. No rush or lineup saturday lunch at 11:30am. The food comes out within 3mins! Worth trying out for sure.
147;Herman Li;02/01/19;1;5;Generally speaking my experience with the quality of food at Sansotei is good like all of the other franchises, but this one was terrible. One of the waitress carried a tray of tall plastic cups all of which were very full and as she was placing the tray down onto our table, the weight of the tray tilted the cups downwards and ultimately poured the entire glass onto my mom's body. The waitress apologized and got a mop to also clean up the place offering paper towels, but the damage control wasn't enough. Water was spilled inside of her purse and her bottoms were wet. Our original waitress was so embarrassed that she switched to a different waiter to serve our table instead. Now, the manager who I presumably believe is a man with a cap with his arms crossed in the kitchen doing nothing but overlooking the entire restaurant and witnessed the entire situation, did absolutely NOTHING to help the situation. At the very end, we received the bill like a normal guest would. The least of my expectation is some sort of recognition of a fault made by their service team whether that be a discount off bill, one meal off, or I would've even accepted their future offer of a discount later. All of which damage control methods were not considered and I'm truly disappointed that they would've think that essentially ignoring an incident that happened, is a valid action of its own. The negligence of their own staff is the accountability of management which they failed to respond to appropriately. I do not recommend this restaurant to fellow foodies, as we know that accommodation is not their strong points as like in other ratings you can see from others.
148;Duncan Li;02/01/19;1;4;I've been to this location several times, it is a small hidden joint at the Dollarama/Laura Secord entrance. There is usually a wait since it is a smaller restaurant, but they do not take your phone numbers down, so do not expect them to call you when a table is ready, you will have to be there physically when they call your name or you will miss your spot. Ramen selection is limited, but the quality is above average/good. Prices are reasonable. The reason for my 1 star review is because of a poor experience we had where the waitress spilled an entire cup of water onto one of us. You only get to witness true customer service in scenarios such as this, and this was completely lacking. She brought over a roll of paper towels to wipe the ground, not even for the guest to wipe off, and then brought a mop once she realized paper towels wasn't going to cut it. The guest, her sweater, her pants and her purse were drenched in water. The waitress was apologetic but nevertheless ruined the entire experience. The 1 star is for a complete lack of customer service.
150;Song-e Baek;04/01/19;4;0;Always line up and you hve to wait around so that u can hear the name called otherwise you gonna loose your spot. Wish they have the ring system. But the food is amazing…
151;Miko Taruc;04/01/19;4;0;The tonkotsublack ramen tasted pretty good. Strong flavour for a decent price. The chicken wings and gyoza were mediocre though. Stick with ramen when you go here.
152;Jeet Johal;05/01/19;5;0;Great place
153;Jolie Leung;06/01/19;3;0;Solid 3 stars, no doubt. Biggest disappointment was that the egg was not marinated in Marin at all, and if it was, there was no taste or egg consistency that it was marinated. Get thick noodles. Thin noodles didnt have the bite that ramen usually has. The cut of pork belly was decent, but it was cut so thinly that it takesaway from enjoying a nice cut of pork.  Portions are small, but comparable to other ramen places. Tonkotsu ramen was a salty mildly creamy broth. It didn't taste like a pork based broth at all.
154;Sean Dawson;07/01/19;5;0;Curated menu of interesting ramen combinations. Pretty good and not too pricey.
155;Jim Tam;10/01/19;3;0;Overhyped,  soup tasted like it was from a can and meat was overcooked, also very limited selection on the menu.
156;Aldous Mendoza;10/01/19;4;0;Very rich broth with each variation of ramen.
157;Chris Hayes;10/01/19;5;0;Beautiful food
158;Blaise Wong;12/01/19;4;0;Pretty authentic looks, but not as fun as downtown locations. The food is very good, and should be a priority if you have a ramen craving while shopping at Square One.
159;Julie Faibish;12/01/19;4;0;Broth was warm and enjoyable, noodles were well cooked. Flavours were nice, however slightly on the oily side. The wait  staff was attentive. Only a 15 min wait time on a Saturday afternoon.
162;Dean Johnston;13/01/19;5;0;Since I have been on a ramen tour lately I had to try Sansotai at Square One. I had the Tonkatsu Black Ramen. This Ramen comes with black garlic oil, hence the name. This ramen has a very rich flavour, that packs a little more punch than standard ramen. Simply delicious.
164;Peter Hayek;16/01/19;2;1;Not the best location
165;Jess Nguyen;16/01/19;5;0;AMAZING!!
167;John Pack;18/01/19;2;1;Served Ramen and gyoza were cold
168;A Pua;20/01/19;4;1;Good ramen and appetizers. Fast service
169;Menroth;20/01/19;2;2;Bland and cold, can not even compare to Kenzo sadly.
170;vnyvc;21/01/19;4;0;We luv the spicy tantan and the employees. But the Gyoza and Fried Chicken can be better.
171;Tien Dang;22/01/19;5;0;Food is good. Love the Black Tonkotsu from Sansotei 👌
172;AZ W;24/01/19;5;0;I'd say I come here almost everyday. The waitresses know me well, so far I haven't experienced any negaive situation. Broth is definitely the best in town.  So are the pork and sides. The only bad thing, as most customers stated, the space is tight and narrow, it's common to wait 30 min during peak hours. I'd suggest avoid peak hours if you don't wanna spend too much time on waitlist.
173;Liza Solomon;26/01/19;4;0;Polite quick service
174;Eric J;27/01/19;3;0;The first time we came here when it first opened they had a ventilation problem and the place was filled with smoke. They have since fix the problem and although the ramen is very good we still prefer Kinton has they have a loyalty card, more selection, more space and food is tastier. Having said that this place is a good alternative as it's conveniently located within Square One. Perfect for a cold winter night when you don't want to step foot outside.
175;Ann Nguyen;28/01/19;4;0;Food is good, lots of fruit flies around.. Pretty unappetizing
176;Reeshma Marie Ramnarine;28/01/19;5;0;Really enjoyed this place! Very fast and cute atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly and explained our options with clarity with regards to taste. She also gave honest opinions on our choices which was wonderful. A tad bit pricey. Spacing between tables is little but it makes for a cozy place - indictive of some restaurants in Japan! I would definitely go back!
178;Annika Ang;02/02/19;4;0;Enjoyed the ramen! Glad to see another ramen place this time popping up in square one. Also tried the gyoza, which was tasty and well-fried, and the mango cheesecake, which was good but super tiny even for just $3.50.
182;Michelle Peng;05/02/19;4;0;Ramen is pretty good, have gotten it more than once! I could probably do without the appetizers though
184;pepsi sisu2;07/02/19;1;2;DO NOT COME HERE, Worst ramen place, the chicken was raw and the server spill it on our clothes, and she did t even apologize and act like nothing happened and left.
185;summer narumi;07/02/19;1;3;Like the other review have pointed out, this place doesn't treat people like people, and for 15 dollars they still serve INSTANT NOODLE type of noodle soup, OVERPRICED and EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
186;Jamie;08/02/19;2;2;Food is always decent here, but the servers are getting more and more inexperienced. I came in and requested to be seated at a certain spot, the server immediately gave me attitude. I sat at the table for 10 minutes and no servers even came to ask me if I wanted water or maybe order. All the servers stood in a group chatting, very unprofessional. Seriously, I probably will never come back cause quality of food is not everything. Service is terrible and if you feel uncomfortable, the food just isn’t as great anymore.
189;Jovy Yung;13/02/19;4;0;Delicious broth!
191;Czr Kalajari;15/02/19;4;0;Ramen soup is delicious!! The place is small but comfortable.
192;Ajay Suresh;16/02/19;5;0;Excellent food and service
194;RedVelvet;17/02/19;5;0;Decent ramen in Mississauga. Sadly they don't offer take out. Highly recommend their black garlic tonkotsu ramen. The broth is rich and creamy and it's perfect for the wintery cold days.
195;Andrew Van;20/02/19;5;0;Sansotei is the best ramen spot in Mississauga. However, the space inside is a little cramped, not much they can do about that for where they are I suppose.
197;samuel so;23/02/19;3;0;Small portion, too pricey
198;Theresa Seow;25/02/19;5;0;The ramen took a little long to come out and they gave us 50% off! Totally unexpected but super appreciated! And it was delicious.
201;Eric Bell;01/03/19;3;0;Good
202;Benita Guevarra;01/03/19;2;0;Being at square 1 is a good location but its very small.  Excited to eat but got really disappointed.  The soup is very fatty and salty. The pork belly full of fats and  the taste of the soup is really bad like the smellnofna pig pen. I couldnt eat it! Sorry but this diapoointed me..
205;Alicia Chhin;04/03/19;5;2;The food here is always amazing. The tonkotsu black is an all time favourite. Serving staff were very friendly and priced reasonably. Waiting times are not as bad here as the one downtown. The restaurant is much more spacious.
206;Kristen C;04/03/19;5;0;First time coming to this location, and it does not disappoint.  Love their ramen and slow cooked wings, unfortunately they only had 5 wings left, but they offered us 20% for the missing wing. Service here was great.
207;ちんエミリー（Emily）;04/03/19;5;1;I have nothing bad to say. Great atmosphere and ramen was delicious! Our server was very nice too. She joked with us when we were talking about getting bubble tea after which I felt, made our experience more personal. I had tomato ramen in Hirakata, Japan and it was my absolute favourite thing so I decided to try it here. It was not the same, but still very tasty! It comes with a huge piece of scallop right in the center... SEAFOOD!!! yum. Only thing I didn't enjoy about this dish was that the mushrooms were really sweet, so it was a bit strange. Tried a bit of the broth of the spicy tantan, bracing myself for the burn that would put me out of commission for the rest of the night, but it was also delicious! Not as spicy as I thought (which is good for me), compared to the one at Kenzo (which HURTS, lol). I highly enjoyed this place, especially since the only other one I've been to was in downtown Toronto and I don't get to visit there that often. This one is a lot closer to where I live!
208;Erubus;04/03/19;5;0;Fast and quality sevice. Food arrived in very reasonable time, and was delectable as expected at this chain. The restaurant is small however, so when it's busy expect to wait for a seat in the mall's entrance, where it's drafty from people coming to and fro.
209;Ben Dijong;05/03/19;5;0;Great food
210;Maddy S;07/03/19;5;0;Came here for late lunch in between shopping with a friend. I've only had ramen once before so I wasn't sure what exactly to order. The menu was small and I didn't understand what everything was. The waitress was as helpful as she could be. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black without the fungus (mushrooms). I actually swapped it for corn instead which was amazing! The pork bone broth is delicious, especially with the added garlic oil. I wasn't a fan of the pork belly slice as it didn't have much flavour. If I could just drink the broth everyday, I'd be in heaven. My friend ordered the Spicy Tantan and said it was the best Raman she's ever had. Better than the other popular Raman places nearby (Kenzo Ramen & Kinton Ramen). The only negative thing is the restaurant is quite small, and you'll sit near other customers quite closely. Not a huge deal, but I didn't want to hear the person next to me slurping their food in my ear.
211;Arnnie Torres;09/03/19;2;0;Did not really enjoy our ramen... kinda frustrated... 😔
212;Weicle Wu;09/03/19;5;0;Same taste as the one at dundas street DT. Glad to have it here in mississauga.
215;Dennis N;13/03/19;4;0;Nice cozy place to have sit down and have ramen. It's a good chain ramen shop and it's probably the best ramen restaurant around the Mississauga area, as far as I know. Although the restaurant itself isn't very large, they offer very quick and courteous service.
216;M Chi;14/03/19;4;0;A typical Japanese noodle place, nothing fancy but authentic, sometimes the queue would be long during rush hours
220;Marcello L;17/03/19;5;1;This restaurant serves delicious ramen noodles and the staff is very polite and professional. Try their Miso Black or their Tonkotsu Black. If you have a big appetite, you can ask for extra noodles on the side (for $1.50 or so) and add them into your dish/bowl whenever you feel ready to do so. Their gyoza are also tasty!
223;William Fong;20/03/19;1;0;too much msg
226;Jackie Chiem;25/03/19;5;0;The food here is absolutely tasty. The portions are decent but the broth makes up for it. I ordered the Miso Black which is one of the most flavourful ramens I've had around the GTA. The Zangi fried chicken had a good traditonal asian taste to it. Will definitely be going again.
233;Florence Doe;07/04/19;5;0;Great ramen. Nice staff and calming atmosphere
236;RAP CANA;14/04/19;5;0;Nice reno, young waiter!
237;Rachel Wong;14/04/19;2;0;While the food was just okay (prefer Santouka), service sucked. The staff don't give wait times, don't ask you before the meal if you have allergies or during the meal how things taste/if you want anything else, don't give refills when you have an empty cup, don't clear empty dishes left sitting on the table, and don't bring you your bill. The pork belly in both my shoyu ramen and the bf's tonkotsu black were leaner and tougher than the ones we got from the Toronto location, and the eggs in both at Square One were cold. Didn't tip.
240;R B;16/04/19;5;0;Love this place! It’s great to see this place has gained some popularity over time as the downtown locations are always packed. The tonkotsku black is my favourite and the spicy tan tan is very good as well.
241;zack Tm;17/04/19;3;0;it looks like they cook it differently still love the one on younge st.
242;sage;18/04/19;5;0;I love Sansotei Ramen! I have been here many times and to the Dundas location and the quality is like no other! I love the Tonkotsu Black and the Tomato ramen! Every time I go here the service and food quality are amazing and always want me coming back for more. The zangi is out of this world and better than other ordinary deep fried chicken. I have tried all the ramen on the menu and personally recommend the shoyu for someone first trying ramen and the tonkotsu black if you are looking for something very flavourful! The staff here are very friendly and welcoming, and very knowledgeable about the menu :) Come here if you want fast and friendly service and yummy ramen!
243;Lilly Tran;18/04/19;5;0;The tonkotsu black and spicy tantan are sooo good! The servers are super attentive and friendly! There’s an open space in the corridor that other ramen places don’t have where you can stand. 10/10 would recommend!!
244;ab s;19/04/19;2;3;The staff working here is welcoming and friendly.  They have good knowledge about their products. However I could not eat there because I am alergic to pork. All their menu has pork base and contents. There are no vegan options
245;Ashleigh Samelko;20/04/19;2;0;"Having been to the downtown and North York locations a handful of times each, prior to visiting this location, I can compare. Especially because I always order black tonkotsu. This location was disappointing. I read the reviews before going, and figured I can deal with bad service, but the ramen should be on par with the other locations... Nope, it's not. The service left a lot to be desired as I had read (basically a bunch of college kids standing around the kitchen chatting to one another), plus the ""cook"" forgot to add the black garlic oil to my soup, and the waitress failed to notice, so I was given a small cup of it to pour on the ramen myself. This would have all been ok if the end result was an awesome bowl of ramen, but it was just meh. I tasted the broth before given the black oil, and obviously afterwards. Bland. Even with the oil. Noodles were sub par also. Chasu was decent, but it didn't make up for the bland broth. I wouldn't go back even if Kenzo Mississauga was closed, and really wanted a bowl of ramen. Waste of money. Worth the drive to North York or downtown, or just go to Kenzo."
248;Mitchel;25/04/19;5;0;"Considering I've had REAL ramen in Japan, Sansotei is the only location I can go to for really good ramen without destroying my wallet. Their menu is small, but everything on it is amazing and even after eating the same dish repeatedly I'm still not tired of it. My personal favorite is the Tonkatsu black (see attached pic) with thick noodles and extra egg or extra noodles if I'm really hungry. The flavors are rich and creamy, and the pork is cooked perfectly every time. For about $15 (depending on what extras you add and what you tip), you'll have a solid well-made meal. The service is fast and all the waiters/waitresses are all very patient and kind. If you have any questions on what is in each dish or what soup base they use, they'll gladly answer any questions. On a side note; their takoyaki is also pretty nice, as well as their gyoza if you feel like mixing it up and getting something aside from just ramen."
250;Austin Williams;02/05/19;5;0;Great place for ramen!! It’s rare to find ramen this good in Sauga~
251;Valerie Lin;02/05/19;5;0;Love this place- the food, atmosphere and service are all spectacular. I particularly love the Spicy Tantan ramen. Food is always fresh and the broth is super flavourful. The servers are always very friendly and accommodating every time we visit. Probably the best ramen in sauga :-)
252;Kuilin Chen;04/05/19;5;0;Spicy tan tan is delicious
255;Ray Biss;08/05/19;5;0;Best ramen in Mississauga, I recommend the Tonkotsu Black. However, I do find that the locations in Toronto are a bit better.
257;Flygon;12/05/19;5;0;My favourite ramen place. Originally went to their location on Dundas st but this one is almost as good. Plus it's way closer to me.
258;Mickizure Legacy;12/05/19;5;0;Thanks for the ramen experience! Be back again soon.
259;Jonny Ishi;12/05/19;5;0;The Black Miso Ramen and the Gyoza remind me a lots the taste  when I lived in Japan! Very delicious 👍
260;Paul Pan;14/05/19;4;0;Had been waiting Sansotei to open in Mississauga and finally they did. Came here on a Saturday noon and wait time was 5 min. Ramen was on par with other locations in Toronto. Update: the fact that Ramen have been on price hike in Toronto makes me sad, it's all the same price now.. Noodle is very chewy and what make Sansotei special is I can tell their noodle is hand-pulled and fresh, unlike other ramen restaurants using noodle packs. However their flavours to choose and portion is the worst among other ramen competitors.
262;Elyse Ryder;16/05/19;3;0;Good broth and noodles! The egg was a little little runny - I prefer a seasoned egg with a jammy center. Not a big selection but lot of add options. Fast service and beautiful decor. Would go again.
263;Michael hamilton;16/05/19;5;0;so good - best in town so far
265;Martin Prollamante;17/05/19;4;0;A very good ramen spot in Mississauga. The location is attached to the mall, which makes it convenient. The food is full of flavour. The Tonkastu Black is served with garlic oil, but the garlic is not overpowering. The Zangi (deep fried chicken) is also very flavourful. The portion size is deceptively filling. The service is very friendly and prompt. Overall, the restaurant only gets 4 stars due to the lack of options. Otherwise, it is worth checking out.
267;Ted martin;19/05/19;4;0;Tasty with extra egg
268;Bill Pong;21/05/19;5;0;Ordered the black miso ramen.  Overall the ramen and broth are fine.  Broth could have been hotter.  The egg is.perfectly cooked for my tastes:  yolk is half cooked and runny, egg white is the same.  A previous reviewer commented on the egg being cold - yes its cold cause the egg is soaked in cold water just after cooking to stop it cooking any further - resulting in the semi poached egg... yum.... Will visit again when in the mall....
270;郭Anne;21/05/19;3;1;why our stuff is so less? Only two super thin slices of meat. 😂
271;chikara persaud;23/05/19;3;4;Ordered :Tonkatsu Black w/ thin noodles. The food was a good 4/5 taste wise and service was good but I had one complaint. I've been to Sansotei in Ottawa quite a few times and I've always had a consistent experience. Here, however, I found my piece of pork was terribly small compared to what I usually get. It was basically two paper towel thick slices of pork. I was used to getting two decently thick pieces at least 3x the size of what I got. I was a little disappointed with this. Otherwise, fairly good. I will update this review if next time I go it is different. **See second photo for pork slice thickness**
273;Eric Vaz;24/05/19;4;0;Had the spicy soup. Was really tasty. Had a nice smokey flavour.
274;Rachel;25/05/19;5;0;I love ramen! The tonkotsu ramen is great here and the soft boiled eggs that come with it are just so soft and so good.
276;Oscar Piel;27/05/19;3;0;Very tasty comparable to down town but not there
278;Sarah Yepez;27/05/19;4;0;Pretry good! Fairly priced and quick service
280;Ashley Luciani;28/05/19;1;5;This place has the worst customer service I've experienced in a very long time. They asked us to wait outside the restaurant while we waited for a table. Then when one became available they would not give it to us because they said it sat four people and we were only two. There demeanor was disrespectful so my Fiance and I chose to leave. So they lost customers for the prospect of customers. Will never go back!
282;Bianka F;30/05/19;2;0;Food was not the greatest..  had better ramen elsewhere. Service was good
284;Michael Owens;03/06/19;4;0;I didn't mind this place.  Fast and tasty
286;Jeje Sir;05/06/19;5;0;I have been to this place multiple times and I consistently get good experiences. The food is good and the service is excellent.
287;Christina Lee;06/06/19;5;1;Cozy ramen spot with amazing service - I literally got my noodles five minutes after ordering! Staff were friendly and attentive, and everything is reasonably priced.
288;Angelo M;06/06/19;4;0;Food is very tasty, however a bit on the salty side, so be warned! This place actually was my very first ramen experience and it was pretty good, They do sell extra noodles on the side however I found the portion of noodles for a $13+ ramen to be on the minimal side. Would definitely return based on taste alone.
291;Sherman D'Souza;08/06/19;4;0;Good ramen. Small menu makes it easy to choose.
295;Audrey Petes;15/06/19;1;1;Not a single entree option without pork! Most ramen places will have an option for that but we actually had to leave when we went due to dietary restrictions.
300;Jo Le;21/06/19;2;0;The 2 stars were given for customer service. The portion sizes were very small for the price that they charge. Ive been to sensotei in toronto where I'm sure the rent is expensive as well but broth was hot and it came with more then 1 or 2 piece of meat. The broth was very salty, I think because the broth was not hot enough. Which is the basics for a good ramen place. Otherwise I'm sure the broth would have tasted good. I got extra spicy but the spice level was very overwhelming. The gyoza was good. The beef on rice on the other hand, again the quality of long stringy chewy beef that went on top was very hard for our kids to eat. The taste was good just the quality of meat. Next time we will probably leave square one and drive down the street where there are 2 really good ramen places.
306;Ameer Bassam;28/06/19;5;0;Friendly staff outstanding meals
307;Manley Skeine;01/07/19;5;0;Great
308;Kiet Nguyen;02/07/19;5;0;Got the tomato
312;muangmin detdara;07/07/19;5;1;(Translated by Google) Great food
315;Nguyen Han;09/07/19;3;1;I ordered the original Tonkatsu with thick noodles. The soup was good but the price is high for getting a bowl of noodles with 2 small slices of pork belly. This is the second ramen restaurant I went in Mississauga besides Kenzo ramen. In Kenzo, you can have a big bowl of ramen for just 14.50 bucks. However, the location of the restaurant is very convenient to go. I suggest you guys the Ramine Drink, it just tastes like a soda but it's really funny to drink.
320;Douglas C;19/07/19;5;0;"Authentic Ramen, good place for a quick meal, however, portion is a bit small for a hungry adult, there is a option for ""extra noodle"" and i recommend anyone who have a good appetite."
324;Michael Jackman;24/07/19;5;1;Very enjoyable but I thought the eggs should be marinated. Had the regular tonkatsu with regular toppings, mushrooms gave it a nice crunch, pork was great and tender - cooked to perfection. Broth is great as well, wanted to drink it all. Finally a good ramen place in the Square One area.
326;camnada;27/07/19;5;0;This place had a good view of sunset.
328;Kate Xia;28/07/19;3;0;Taste was fine, but definitely not impressive. Also, the portion was a bit small.

339;Jade Matthew;13/08/19;5;0;The ramen here is extremely flavorful with the broth being a deep and hearty one that isnt too heavy and layered with fat. The ramen that is my favourite is shoyu with thin noodles (not much difference from thick), its light but has a really warming and rich flavour, it has to be my favourite place rhus far that I've been to eat ramen.
343;Mi Rama;15/08/19;1;0;I didnt visited ,google map is wrong
345;ゴンちゃん;15/08/19;5;0;(Translated by Google) It was delicious ramen like eating in Japan

347;Karthik Thani;18/08/19;5;0;Fantastic friendly service with a smile. Yummy food with that Japanese taste. A place for a evening casual date. Highly recommend.
349;Leanzaa;21/08/19;5;1;I came with a group of 5 on a Saturday night, I was told it was half an hour wait, which wasn't too bad. The space is small. The food was pretty good  and the price was worth it. The staff was really nice and helpful. I definitely will be visiting again.
350;Lyse Bakfive;21/08/19;5;0;I just love this place....
352;Kris Buzmion;23/08/19;4;4;A little small location but then again, mostly of ramen places have this a little tight space. Ramen was delicious. You have options to choose from, but comparing to other ramen places I've tried the options is not as many. The broth is very flavorful. Love the tonkatsu. Options to change your pork to chicken. Staff are nice and the place is maintained. Highly recommended for ramen lovers esp in Mississauga area!

357;Sharon Mai;25/08/19;5;0;Great food, great service! It is a small location though, so you might have to wait to be seated but it's  definitely worth it!
358;Derek Leung;25/08/19;5;0;I had the Tonkatsu Black and the zangi and both were great. Would definitely be coming back again.
360;Sam Sabapathy;30/08/19;3;2;Ramen is inconsistent here. Some days it's pretty good, on others, the same Ramen not so good. Service is very good, with friendly staff.
362;K L;31/08/19;5;0;So good ! Clean cute place and staff are friendly. The ramen is so good I got the spicy tantan with thin noodles and I would order it again.
364;Shalini Santhanasamy;01/09/19;5;0;Super Delicious. Two words for their ramen and zangi chicken. Their ramen broth is rich and tasty.

371;Nav Wirach;09/09/19;5;0;Ordered the spicy tantan, the slow cooked wings along with the gyoza. Delicious ramen and sides, flavourful broth. Very reasonable price!

404;Saima Samuel;09/10/19;3;1;Has a busy and rushed atmosphere like any other Asian restaurant. The ramen wasn’t what I was hoping for, but wasn’t the worst either
405;Irene T;09/10/19;4;1;Sansotei has always been consistent and easily accessible. Delicious ramen as always but too much noodle, not enough cha siu and too salty. Their zangi (deep fried chicken) is really tender and juicy but not as flavourful as I'd like.
407;Benjie Lopez;12/10/19;5;0;Nice ramen....
409;Yan Yan Zhu;14/10/19;5;0;Sansotei offered a fantastic dinning experience. Wandered into the restaurant on a Thursday night, around 630 pm. We were quickly greeted and seated by friendly staff. She was very knowledgeable and when asked, she was very help in coming up with suggestions for our dinner. We ordered a tonkotsu (with extra noodles) and spicy tan tan, both with less salt. As for side dishes, we got an order of Zangi and Gyoza. Amazing food!! I highly recommend it!
410;Briana Leigh;14/10/19;5;0;Best ramen in mississauga! And the staff is so friendly.
414;Serena S;19/10/19;5;0;Flavourful broth, chewy noodles and nicely seasoned chashu - the Tonkatsu Ramen is always my go-to.
416;Christina Ha;20/10/19;5;0;Good ramen but limited choices in the menu. Small place right infront of Su & Bu.
419;R A;22/10/19;2;1;Came here for lunch and ordered the Shoyu. Only had a few slivers of meat, and when I say slivers, I mean anorexic thin 😭!! Even my date agreed that there was a scarcity of meat in their bowl compared to the other garnishings and noodles itself, which to me seems cheap and is not worth $12. I've had better ramen in Willowdale so this place does not even compare. Won't be coming back and would not recommend unless you want to waste your time.
420;Joanna “y0ungst3r” Buluran;23/10/19;3;0;It was good, but when I was eating I found two pieces of short hair on my ramen. So don't know if I will eat here again, but please watch this please. Shouldn't have this on food.
421;Ann Wu;24/10/19;2;0;Excellent service​ 👍. . I ordered​ Tonkotsu Black​ which only had 2​ 1/2 small pieces pig urine smell pork belly , so disgusting. The broth​ was light which was very eclipsed compared with Toronto Sansotei Ramen . They need to improve their food quality and portion.
422;Clam;24/10/19;4;0;"One of the better ramen places in Mississauga. Good hearty tonkatsu broth. You can choose the thickness of your noodles. I prefer thick but it's not crazy thick, maybe like approx. 4mm? Meat is okay, tasty but thin. Service is relatively fast. Tables are clustered quite closely together that you can easily overhear people's conversation without trying to. But that's kind of normal in most ramen shops. Previously you would put your name down with a server on a list but now they have updated to Yelp waitlist. As of today, you can not put yourself in line remotely; you have to add your name to the list via tablet outside the restaurant. This is a welcomed change because you leave your cell # and can walk away and get text updates or watch the list on your phone."
425;Billy Walters;26/10/19;2;0;Expensive AF. 😒
431;Sean Adver;02/11/19;5;0;Came eat here a lot of times. Just love the taste of the noodles and soup here. Umami flavor with tasty toppings. Just a incredible place to

448;Ray GG;11/11/19;3;1;(Translated by Google) The soup is generally tasteless, and the noodles are also average, generally not recommended. Give Samsung all because of the service.
450;bloodakamaru;13/11/19;5;0;Great place to satisfy your ramen cravings, easy to access since it's located in square one
455;Chantall Wire Creations;17/11/19;5;0;Excellent Ramen!
456;Massimo Giallo;18/11/19;3;1;Sansotei Ramen is balanced considering its price, flavour, toppings and portions. The Tonkotsu ramen doesn't leave me feeling super full, just content. The broth was not too salty and it has simple toppings of fungus, creamy eggs and two thin slices of pork belly. My friend prefers the Shoyu ramen. We could have done without the Zangi appetizer, which came after our noodles, good portions and had a crunchy outside but were a little dry and needed more taste. Left with only a couple options, it is one of the few places for good ramen in Mississauga. A small place, here on a busy Friday night and siting at the tables close by the servers area, it remained pretty loud. Wished we could have sat further away from their desk if that would help... loud, little service, tight.. Decent ramen but (if you have a choice) better locations.
461;Danica A;26/11/19;4;0;Not spicy..but great ramen!
464;Alex Liu;30/11/19;5;0;Great ramen. Firm noodles, delicious broth, and very generous toppings!
467;Alysse S;01/12/19;4;1;Soup could have been hotter. But solid and IMO better than Kinton.  Staff is very nice and the music was a vibe!
469;tania martina;07/12/19;4;0;Taste good. Limited space, the table was so packed. This is not the place for spending time to hang out, talking with colleague as other customers are waiting for the table.
474;USER USER;15/12/19;5;0;The Tonkatsu Black Ramen is a great reason to be alive, I cannot recommend this place enough.

486;MissY N;30/12/19;4;0;Food consistently good. Ambience not so authentic anymore, very different from downtown locations. IPad reservations handy
487;Jenny H;30/12/19;4;0;Ramen was good.  Wait time was about 15-20 minutes on a Monday afternoon at 2pm. You enter your name and phone number on the iPad at the entrance, and will get a text message when it's close to your turn.  This place seems to be constantly busy even outside of regular lunch time. It would be nice if the restaurant could be a little bigger.
488;Jeffrey Qiu;02/01/20;4;0;"Great ramen and reasonable prices. Offers both thin and thick noodles (I would consider them on either end of ""regular"" sized ramen noodles). However, the menu is very small and differs from other Sansotei locations. Also the restaurant is small and there is almost always a wait (especially during peak hours). You can sign up for a waiting list outside that will let you know where you are in the queue. Take this into account when timing and fill it out a bit before you actually want to eat."
494;Beini Wang;04/01/20;3;0;Broth was a tad too salty for my liking
495;Peter;04/01/20;2;2;Unfortunately it doesn’t meet the same level as Kinton and Kenzo. Food was below average. Minus 1 star for unhappy service staff.
496;Jonathan Wu;05/01/20;4;0;The noodle is bouncy and full of spirit. Broth is thick and nicely balanced with miso. Chasu needs a bit more work.
497;Virginia Mathews;05/01/20;1;0;Worst ramen ever. Walked out.
498;Adrian Chang;05/01/20;5;2;If you have been to any of the other Sansotei ramen locations downtown you know what you are looking for. Sansotei is one of my favourite ramen stores in the GTA, it is really good and I just came back from Japan 3 months ago! I got the Miso Black with thick noodles which was very tasty and flavourful. The egg was perfectly cooked but I did find the broth to be a little thicker (compared to Japan ramen, this isn't a bad thing just different). We also got the spicy slow cooked wings, they are a tad spicy so just be aware. The meat was super tender and soft. These aren't like your wings from All Star Wings, Wild Wings or any other chain. These are slow cooked in sauce, they are not breaded or deep fried. Worth a try if you like chicken wings and spice, it came with 5 wings when we ordered it!
501;Vicki Leung;06/01/20;4;0;Decided to try the Sansotei at the Square One location after an appointment across from Square One today. I had the tomato ramen and their new gyoza (negi shota gyoza? I forget...One of the words means green onions). The food tasted good. Nothing special about the gyoza, but it does have some green onions inside as opposed from just meat, and tonnes of green onions scattered on top (I put the leftover green onions into my ramen broth). I was pleasantly surprised about the size of the Hokkaido scallop in my ramen (the large thing in the middle of my bowl in the pictures). I finished the meal off with a slice of mango cheesecake (not made in house). It was alright (tasted fine, just not sure I would pay $3.50 for the small slice again).
503;James Fung;08/01/20;3;0;Portions are getting smaller than before.
504;Alka Verma;11/01/20;5;2;After reading about such great reviews about this restaurant we decided to  try this out in Square one was not too. sure as I’m not too fond of Ramen The menu was short and bang on only their specials Came here at 8 pm and the restaurant was quite full on a Monday evening Our server had us seated and what caught my eye was different colours of serving bowls for different flavours We asked the server about their best and high selling Ramens She advised us Spicy Tantan and Tonkatsu We also ordered a helping of Gyozas too The service was was quick and we got our soup within 7 minutes without the gyozas which was to come later Appetizers after the meal so we requested the server to cancel the Gyoza order which she did thankfully and we ordered a fried chicken for our friend who didn’t eat pork The Ramen tasted super awesome I ordered as I preferred the Spicy Tantan which comes with ground pork and pork belly Could taste garlic and sesame flavours  Absolutely loved it The other Ramen Tonkatsu was excellent too Both of them were the best ramens I ve ever eaten The interiors and the service was good too. Recommended as one of the best ramen places in GTA

515;Lam Duy;21/01/20;5;0;One of the best Ramen restaurant I've ever had in Mississauga. The soup is tasty but a little bit too strong, but the noodle, pork and eggs are superb delicious. The service here is quite good. This place is clean and bright, located near Walmart in Square One. Will come back here again for another Miso Black Ramen.

520;Theodore Callender;25/01/20;5;0;A few friends and I decided to grab ramen for dinner while we were out and were not disappointed. The broths of our different dishes were all quite rich, the flavours were well balanced, and the price and overall portions were modest as well. The customer service was good as well, definitely would recommend!

529;Ando Oomae (大前安藤);03/02/20;1;1;I was eating ramen and when I ate my egg, there was still an egg shell stuck to it. Everything is over priced for the little portion you get. Servers are rude and you need to call them in order to put your order in.
530;Ahmed AL-Gaity;03/02/20;1;2;I work in the same mall as this place and they have you wait 5 minutes for my food, so if I’m at work and want to call in to place my order so I can have it ready in time for my break, but they won’t take phone take out orders even if I’m a regular and force you to get an app just so you can get the same service as you calling in and placing your order. Also do not know what’s going on with their portions but they’d been getting smaller since I started being a customer.
533;alex lobal;05/02/20;4;0;Very good but lack enough options, would like 1 more app or soup option.

547;Kelvin Wong;18/02/20;4;0;food is great but the seating is quite tight. also no bar stool seating so not as authentic as real ramen bar in Japan.
550;Lemuel Cang;20/02/20;4;0;I ordered the shoyu bowl, my friend ordered tonkotsu. They both looked almost identical, aside from my friend ordered extra pork. They tasted exactly the same. So im pretty sure i was given the wrong order, but i just wanted good food. And it was. Price is reasonable.
554;Tee Le;24/02/20;5;0;With all the ramen places that open up in Mississauga. I would have to say this place has the best ramen.
557;Francisco Felix;25/02/20;5;0;First visit to Sansotei... I have officially become a fan!!! Menu is small but straight to the point... Very good ramen... Quality is top notch... Staff is friendly and always eager to help... 100% recommended!
558;Robert Ma;25/02/20;4;0;I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel like this branch is slightly worse than the downtown branch in terms of both food and service. Still good though.
562;Dennis Pham;02/03/20;5;0;I always get the tonkatsu black.
566;B B;05/03/20;2;0;A little overpriced for a ramen place, prob because of the Square one area.  The quality however is not good at all.  Size of the meal is small for what I was paying.  Seating is very tight also.
568;Fulbert Fu;06/03/20;2;0;Overpriced.

573;Shaun;09/03/20;1;1;Awful. The Ottawa location is a million times better
576;Shell Liza;09/03/20;3;2;I had Sansotei once before downtown and did not care for it too much, and have other preferred places for ramen. I wanted to try it again, and I got the spicy tan tan. The broth was overly salty, some of the ingredients like the bamboo shoot were cold, I assumed the soup would warm it. The pork was tender and the noodles were cooked right. For 13 dollars a bowl, I expected more toppings. I know more are available for an additional purchase. I also had the zangi (fried chicken), it was good but nothing special. I probably won't come again, as the value and quality isn't comparable to other great ramen places.
582;Harrison Chen;14/07/20;5;0;Yummy food, fast, fairly priced, great quality, friendly staff.
583;Kayla Luo;15/07/20;1;2;Star is for the food. I've been a frequent visitor of sansotei for years and their food is genuinely good. however their way of handling the pandemic failed miserably. Unless you have unlimited amount of time to wait, don't think about ordering from them directly for takeout as they don't take over-the-phone orders. meaning you have to go in person to order, unknowing how long the wait would be as no one can tell you how many ppl are already in line and how much stuff they ordered before you actually get there. they would drastically underestimate the wait time (by 50%-100%) to lure you in, but after that it's all luck. if they can survive thru the pandemic that's great, but how they achieve that with its current way of operations is beyond me.
584;Pennina-Lynn Cobb;16/07/20;5;0;My boyfriend and I ordered ramen and gyoza from here for the first time, and it was delicious! 10/10, would come here again!
585;Marieyo Ngume;17/07/20;5;0;The best mall ever!!!
586;Ger D C;04/08/20;1;1;Worst place to wait for your dinner! Do not go here!
589;Andrew Truong;18/08/20;1;1;First they suppress using a particular payment even though they take it and they then reduce the pork to 1 price just to spite me. Worst park is that it was takeout during covid and I didn't know till I got home. Snake move.. If I could give zero stars I would. Such shady business conduct
591;Matthew Kosichek;20/08/20;5;0;Best tonkotsu broth in town. The cha shu is so tender it falls apart when you try to pick it up (that's a good thing). Get the chicken zangi too, great flavour and fried to perfection
595;王simon;29/08/20;1;1;We came around 1:35pm, and there are several empty tables. The waitress told us tables are reserved, we need to wait for 15 mins for next table. We waited for 15 mins, and those reserved tables are still empty. We asked again, she told us we need to wait 2:15 pm to see if reserved people are not coming. There’s 40mins gap between we came and the reservation time, but waitress didn’t let us sat and eat. I feel like this restaurant doesn’t want to do business at all.
597;John Doe;01/09/20;4;0;It's a little expensive but it's good
598;Melissa Wheeler;01/09/20;5;0;Great take out service. Fast and fresh. Can't go wrong here.
600;Anastasia Beaverheusen;04/09/20;1;1;I ordered on Skip, after realizing it was in a mall I had instant regret. The food arrived cold and tasted salty af like an ex-wife at your wedding! They packed the ramen noodles with the soup so it was a giant blob when it arrived. Never eat ramen from a mall food court.
602;Justin Cook;08/09/20;5;0;I've eaten at a lot of ramen shops in the city, and I'm pretty sure this is the best broth of the mall. Go with Tonkotsu black and you won't regret it.
604;Rebecca Hancock;20/09/20;5;0;I didnt really think this place would be that great but holy was I wrong, the food is amazing the price is amazing the staff was amazing. Very impressed!
610;Ann Toronto;31/10/20;5;0;Great take out. Nicely packaged. Felt clean and safe. Tasty broth. Highly recommend for take out Ramen. Bit pricey but worth it.
611;Mandy;15/11/20;4;0;On a cold, rainy day like today I love a nice hot bowl of ramen. My go to favourite has to be the Black Tonkotsu made with garlic oil. For more food pictures and restaurant reviews in the GTA, check out @CityGirl.Eats on Instagram! 📸 Black Tonkotsu 💰$$

619;What's That;14/02/21;3;1;This place is average when compared to other options in Toronto. It is below average when it comes to ramen from Japan. We got the tonkotsu ramen and the broth was thin and salty. It was missing the rich broth that makes it so delicious.
620;Johnathan Chau;20/03/21;4;0;Their miso black and spicy tantan ramen are great, the zangi was okay. it takes a while for the ramen to come out but the service is great
621;Anthony Xavier;28/07/21;5;4;Service is great with ACTUAL Japanese speaking waiters, and the whole process is quick. Washroom is pretty nice with cool AC and nice atmosphere. The menu is small though. The price is okay and as someone who rarely eats pork, it was very tasty. Would recommend. I got an extra refill of the noodle (kaedama) which isn’t necessary but if you want a lot of noodles for sure get it. The service is VERY quick which is always a good thing!
622;Khem Mangal;20/08/21;4;0;Although small, this place packs a punch if you love good ramen, and good polite service. I had the Gyoza, and the Miso Black, and didn't regret it.....love the atmosphere, again small but packs a punch with flavor
623;Joshua Pineda;21/08/21;5;0;Amazing Food with quality service from our server Peter! He was very attentive and helpful to any questions or needs of my partner and I. I would definitely come back for the service alone!
624;Doan Le;25/08/21;5;0;There’s never any wait time when it comes to getting seated. The ramen is so flavourful and the presentation is great. The food always comes out quick too. Peter is a great server and is quick to help us out when needed.
626;Jarod Tracey;05/09/21;5;0;Delicious ramen at a reasonable price, I will certainly be returning. I had the tonkatsu+ and I would recommend adding corn and black garlic oil.
627;Tre Cabanit;05/09/21;5;0;The Ramen with egg and pork is flavorful.. it's the soup of Miso Black that makes it phenomenal .. and to add up with Gioza is a great combination.. mouthwatering food in topnotch quality, fast service with politeness from the crews is something that I can recommend from friends and family who's into Japanese dish! 5 star for all of you guys!
629;Anne T;10/09/21;5;2;One of the best ramen I’ve ever had and I’ve had a lot even in Japan. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black and it did not disappoint at all! Very flavourful and rich. Good portion size and not too pricey. I’ll be back to try more menu items soon! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
630;Marsie P;11/09/21;1;6;Absolutely awful service. They give you 5 minutes to get to your table. We had our 90 year old grandma with us and even with seeing her gave our table away. Saying nothing they can do it was the app they use. Good way of shrugging it off like it isn't your fault. We had come back previously to see if the table was ready and the girl who clearly didn't care told us to come back after we got the text. My grandma can't move fast enough she has a cane for godsake. Their staff didn't care. Doesn't matter I would suggest going to any other place anyway. Their ramen is subpar anyway. Never coming back. If I could give you 0 stars I would.
631;Mae Andrea;17/09/21;5;2;I highly recommend this ramen place! Me and my boyfriend came here few days ago. It was a good timing we came because we were at the mall and we were hungry. This is also my first time trying this place and food out! We ordered miso black ramen with extra corn, including extra noodles on the side + deep fries chicken. It was so fresh and well cooked. We indulged everything with a happy tummy haha. There was not alot of people dining either which was great. The server we had is so accomodating as well as all the employees. We absolutely love our experience, can't wait to come back again!
633;J.T. B;20/09/21;1;3;Food is great but the workers at the front desk that deals with reservations are rude, obnoxious and doesn't know how to be polite.  Been to many other locations from this chain and this is the rudest location I've ever been to.  They should take some customer service  training or learn from the other locations.  Go to the North York or downtown location, at least they have way better service.
634;Randy C;25/09/21;5;0;Really like this place. Super cozy and tasty ramen.
637;Albert Jayson Gabriel;03/10/21;1;1;TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!
639;Jas;03/10/21;1;3;Poor customer service and all staff are rude. They’ll make you wait longer though the seat is ready and they’ll make so much excuses. Try to go somewhere else instead. Would definitely not come back here!
643;Flint Zeegers;24/10/21;5;0;I recently moved here and one of the few things I missed from my hometown was the ramen shop. I never thought I'd find one that compared, but after eating a few times at the Sansotei Ramen in Square One? I think I've found something even better. The ramen here is absolutely delicious, I recommend the Shoyu, and a side of the Zangi (fried chicken). It's so good. The staff are always kind and attentive, and the music they play here is stellar. There's such a wonderful atmosphere about this place. I think I'll be coming here at least once a week until I die or the wonderful staff changes. If you're looking for a amazing ramen shop, stop. You've found it.
646;Wang Ashley;27/10/21;1;0;bad service
647;Kevin Rowley;31/10/21;1;0;Our party of two signed up to their electronic waitlist with two parties ahead of us (one party of 5 and one of 6). After waiting for 40 minutes outside the restaurant, a different party of two was seated ahead of us. They were not on the waitlist. Could not justify waiting any longer and we left.
649;Tony Mlakar;02/11/21;2;0;went yesterday and ordered an extra egg because that's my favorite part of ramen. Unfortunately this location isn't marinating their eggs so I just got plain soft boiled eggs. extremely disappointing. Will adjust review if they start marinating eggs again like they are supposed to.
650;jerico ray dizon;03/11/21;5;0;Best ramen in town
653;jenna Wong;09/11/21;4;0;Really enjoyed my meal here. friendly staffs, the food came out fast. fair price for the food.
655;J W;14/11/21;5;0;Three words: Black garlic tonkotsu. Everything here is good, but it’s worth going for that alone. The other meat and vegan options are tasty as well if pork isn’t your thing.
656;Amber Evans;18/11/21;5;0;I love this restaurant. I've had a few other ramen places in Toronto but I'll always choose this one first. The broth and noodles are far superior to any other places out there. I love them so much!
658;Braedon K;20/11/21;2;1;The ramen was okay. It was a tad expensive for what it was. I've had better but, it's not horrible
660;jugster;21/11/21;5;0;me and my family eat here often, if you like salty the miso black is the way
662;Christopher Huynh;25/11/21;5;0;Gooooodd food
663;Demi;27/11/21;4;0;The ramen was amazing! Just wish the space was bigger and less cramped
664;Diocon Pal;29/11/21;4;0;Noodle soup was good but a lot salty for me. Seemed like it is loaded with MSG (monosodium glutamate) food enhancer. I had to drink water everytime I eat coz of saltiness of the soup.
665;Tim Solomons;02/12/21;5;0;The Miso Black is AMAZING here
668;Nick Michon;05/12/21;1;0;"Ordered delivery on ubereats, after waiting an hour it was cancelled.  Called them and they said they never made the order, and ""don't know how it happened"" and ""it never happened before"".  Don't waste your time ordering online with these clowns."
669;Stanley C;14/12/21;5;2;This is one of my favorite ramen. I started enjoying Sansotei in the Toronto downtown location many years ago, so glad they have it in Mississauga at Square One. It has always been crowded and be expected long line up. Love the Tonkotsu, Spicy Tan Tan and Tomato ramens. Usually add extra noodles. Restaurant is nicely decorated and clean.  Washrooms are clean and well maintained. If you have kids/babies, they provide high chair and usually give you the tables closer to the entrance, which has more space for the strollers. They do check the vaccination certificates and ID carefully which is good.
670;Sonny N;15/12/21;4;0;Went to Sansotei at Sq 1. As with this chain, the ramen is always good no matter the location.  Had the tonkutsu.
673;Ariel Honigsman;20/12/21;1;0;Due to Covid Restrictions, they are trying to keep an empty table between occupied tables which is reasonable! I came in asking for a table of 4, they asked me to wait for my table as they couldn’t sit my party of 4, but kept allowing tables of 2 as they could be properly spaced out. The problem is that they allowed so many tables of 2 that my table of 4 couldn’t sit on the 15 minutes waiting time they had advised, (as they allowed tables of 2, my party could never fit. A waiting time that was supposed to be of 15 minutes according to the receptionist, took more than 30 at which point I came in and complained and still there was no table available for me! I gave up!
674;Alyssa;23/12/21;5;0;Great staff and hot fresh ramen! Slightly salty but still good!
679;Alyona Kalachova;01/01/22;5;0;The ramen was exactly the same like I had in Montreal. The place is smaller and not as fancy as other locations, but the food and service are still the same. We waited for our order for 10 mins max.
681;Sarah DC;12/01/22;5;0;So delicious!
686;Ashkan Y;11/02/22;1;4;Unbelievable! Charged me $17 and we got less than half the meat we get at two other ramen locations in the area. One small thin slice of pork.very little miso and just overall very unsatisfactory! We just thought we should give it a try. Should’ve read the reviews before stepping in this place! Also for take out they force you to stay outside the restaurant eventhough it’s was almost entirely empty! Pretty much kicked me out and said wait outside! This is NOT during lockdown
687;Brendan Linseman;20/02/22;1;0;Dish was missing ingredients. Both kitchen and waitress tried to pass it off like nothing was wrong. When called on it, admitted it was missing and  refused to do anything about it.  Been going here or other locations for 8 years, won't be wasting time or money here again. With how it was made I might as well have had instant ramen.
688;Litao Li;20/02/22;5;0;The best ramen in Mississauga
689;Abhinav Sharma;22/02/22;4;0;The staff is super friendly!
690;Berman G;22/02/22;4;1;A sleek Japanese restaurant at the City Centre of Mississauga. As usual, the staff are very polite.
691;Jayzel Jomy;24/02/22;5;0;Absolutely delicous every time!! Love the location 2 because its practically inside the square one, so its nice to go there whenever i end up needing to transfer from city center transit terminal. 10/10 would go again! (*꒦ິ꒳꒦ີ)
694;jazmine;13/03/22;3;1;I usually really like Sansotei. The location at Square One is a little bit small, but the food is really good. The portions are a little small for the price, but overall the ramen is good. I went to Sansotei the other day and they got my order wrong. It was no big deal, so I notified the server. I wasn't angry at all, and I didn't wanna seem picky, but I told her that they gave me the wrong noodles (I ordered thin, but got thick) The server said that the kitchen must have confused it, and said sorry, THEN WALKED AWAY. Like???? I'm sorry, are you not gonna fix my order? Regardless if thick vs. thin noodles aren't a big deal, I want what I ordered. While she was in the area of my table, I called her again and asked her to kindly fix my order. She asked me what I wanted them to do about it. She obviously didn't want to fix my order, and kept delaying on getting a new bowl for me. It was around 7:20, maybe close to closing? But I shouldn't have to eat what I didn't order, just because it would be inconvenient for them. I ended up getting a new bowl, but the whole incident was very irritating. If my order is wrong, you fix it. No question about it. I can't believe she didn't offer a replacement in the beginning. I had to ASK FOR A REPLACEMENT. At the end of it, I paid full price. At that point, I was over the whole ordeal, but compensation for their mistake would have been nice. Even a small discount, I would have appreciated. I definitely won't be back after this.
695;mike dowling;20/03/22;5;0;Best ramen experience ever, must try the black garlic oil
697;Mike LL;03/04/22;4;0;I will stick to my Spicy Tantan and Tonkutsu...
700;Carol F;13/04/22;5;1;Amazing service, staff and food! Simple menu and straight to the point, can't go wrong with ramen! This Sansotei Ramen location is a great addition to Square One. Located next to Exit 9 (near Dollarama), it has it's own separate location without needing to browse through the mall. Their ramen is inspired off of the Kyushu and Hokkaido regions of Japan so their broth may be different from other ramen places. (Different regions have a different broth thickness, density and style). With 6 different ramen choices and thick or thin noodles to choose from, there's a bit for everyone! I personally love the Tomato Ramen that comes with Chashu (Pork), Hokkaido Scallop, Egg, Tomato and Shiitake Mushrooms). I've been here several times and it's been consistent from day one the restaurant opened in 2018. Even during, pre- and post-pandemic, the food quality is still consistent! Staff is pretty responsive and they do a great job with cycling customers and cleaning tables immediately after! At one point, they even signed up for the Yelp Waitlist as well - but they also can put your name down on a waitlist. Either way, they're pretty good at turnaround and service. When waiting for take-out orders or waiting for a table, they have a big area (still within the mall) that you can wait outside. It's spaced out and roomy and doesn't block the main entrance or blocking service. They prefer customers to wait outside which is better than inside as they have limited space.
702;Rachel Tran;30/04/22;4;0;a very convenient location to get ramen while shopping around square one. the servers are very nice and treated my friend and i with great service.
703;Ara A;03/05/22;5;0;Favourite ramen place in the city
704;Alex L;07/05/22;5;0;Best ramen in the city! The tonkotsu ramen was amazing! Must try!
706;Zarwah;10/05/22;4;3;Ramen!! This is the spot for getting a delicious and heartwarming bowl of Ramen. My friend and I got the only vegetarian option on the menu as everything else is meat based (especially pork). It was delicious! Perfect level of seasoning and spice. The service was fast and really friendly. Highly recommend checking it out!
708;Lena Chen;13/05/22;5;1;The service was great and instant lol, our ramen was ready immediately after order, wow. The soup base was rich creamy and deep in flavour but somehow not heavy. The ramen was perfect and tasty, with a hint of roasted garlic? Yumm. Wonderful bowl of ramen.
710;Gus Kalbhenn;18/05/22;2;1;Not what I am used to in a ramen restaurant.  It was definitely a 2 star
712;Bharathi Rao;26/05/22;4;0;This place is located in Square One mall in Mississauga next to Dollarama. They have a variety of ramen soups that are all pork based. Many soups have eggs on the side. You can request them to change the vegetables.
713;Harry Zheng;30/05/22;4;3;I got the Tonkatsu Ramen for $16 and the broth is very light with flavourful ingredients in the bowl. I tried my friends' Tonkatsu Black and Tonkatsu+ and the flavours were stronger. However, the broth was a miss for me in both the + and the black bowl, but I can see others liking it. The service was reasonably fast and the servers checked up regularly to refill our waters, but there was only one out of four menus to begin with. Overall, the ambiance is very cozy and modern, but if you don't want any zany flavours, I'd recommend the regular Tonkatsu bowl.
714;Dakota Tram;04/06/22;3;1;On waiting list for around 10 minutes. Staff is friendly and nice. The ramen is too salty for me but the meat is well marinated.
715;Jamey R;05/06/22;5;0;(Translated by Google) Stopped by after a movie. The Shoyu Ramen was delicious props to the chefs and the amazing service by the waitresses who were all extremely friendly and affable. Would visit again!
716;Emmanuel Appiahkubi;08/06/22;5;0;Great staff. Very friendly
717;Andrew Schuch;12/06/22;4;0;Alright. Location is very small but service was good. Will have to try again. Poor customer service. They forgot to include an item which was paid for.
718;Melissa Lynch;27/06/22;5;0;This ramen was delicious! The first time I have ever seen tomato ramen offered and it was amazing. The service was fast and the food fantastic.
719;Sam H;10/07/22;3;2;Not friendly for people who don't eat pork since all their broth is pork based. They have only 1 vegetarian option and it's not ramen, It was okay, felt like I was just eating it since I spent money on it rather than enjoying the meal. Unfortunately due to my dietary restrictions I most likely won't be coming back, other than that the location is very aesthetic and I'm sure the if you can eat the ramen it is a better experience.
720;Felipe Urrea;12/07/22;5;0;Went there with girlfriend and while I was out she accidentally ordered ramen with pork broth, the waitress was extremely accommodating and kind to the issue at hand and made a dish just for her that didn’t include any pork. With the ramen also being really good I would recommend this place to anybody. Very cozy.
721;icetink;07/08/22;5;3;This place does not disappoint! Been going here since they opened and their broths have been outstanding. Good to see that they've maintained quality. Their thick noodles are far better than their thin noodles (texture and chew) but still not as good as some other ramen places. Pork is a little sweeter and egg not as flavourful, but the egg is cooked perfectly. Service is great, atmosphere is good (a little tight but still comfortable). Always a happy experience here.
722;Sally Yeung;07/08/22;2;0;Ordered TONKOTSU ramens + a few sides for dinner after a fun time at Rec Room.     Toppings were good but the soup broth was quite oily.  The gyoza is T&T frozen dumpling at best.    We also ordered fried chicken as a side but after waiting for 10 min or so, we saw that the table which came after us got the fried chicken.  After asking the server, they realized they made a mistake and gave our order to the table next to us.  There were only three tables eating at the time with 4-5 servers, so not sure how they could make a mistake that way.  Obviously the table beside us pretended not to know and started eating as soon as the chicken was placed on their table.  After we finished all the food, the chicken finally came but it was overdone and my kids don't want to eat anymore.  In the end, the table beside us got the chicken for free and we have to wait extra long for the food to come.  A disappointed experience overall.  Will not visit again.
723;Richard;09/08/22;1;0;Too salty of a broth
724;Araceli Ortiz;11/08/22;5;0;Absolutely delicious meal! And excellent service 😊 They gave us bowls to share with our kids, and even cut up the noodles for our youngest. Group of 6, all our food was hot and delicious. Two tonkostu ramen, shoyu ramen, tonkostu black ramen, gyoza, and zangi. Everything was sooooo good. My shoyu ramen was very hot, savory and the noodles were perfect! Thank you for the delicious meal!
726;Wilbert Lee;30/08/22;4;0;Edit: Manager has contacted me back and understand the situation and apologized for the issue. He will retrain his staff. I am glad the manager was willing to cooperate with me over the phone and looked up the accessibility in Ontario. The restaurant discriminated someone with a service dog with legal document. I will be filing another business complaint. They only allow those with disability in the restaurant. They also refuse to give the names of those refusing services, if you have a service dog you better be handicapped or they will discriminate against you.
728;Parman Gill;07/09/22;5;0;Great ramen, best broth.
729;Jay-R Ramos;10/09/22;5;1;Service was fast. Cozy place.
731;PEANUT;30/09/22;5;0;Good ramen, speedy service. Will visit again
732;Mae Mae;06/10/22;5;1;One of the best Ramen places in Mississauga and very considerate of guests’ allergies. They gave us the allergy sheet one time when my partner asked for it. I don’t think any other places we’ve been to has a well put together allergy sheet like that before. They’re tonkotsu ramen and zangi chicken are to die for.
734;Dahlia Hall;08/10/22;4;0;Love the menu, very nice broth flavors. There are no chicken options in the ramen most of it is chasu, but it tastes very good! We were unsure if the vegetarian option included soup or not, and the fried chicken was also very good but a bit underflavoured. We had a great experience with the staff they are amazing and very kind. The wait time was very short and the tables are kept very clean. Thank you for an amazing experience!
735;Gravity “Gravity”;08/10/22;4;0;This location is pretty small so if you can hit it when it's not busy, it's great. Ramen had a unique flavor I've never had prior, I'd go here again :)
736;TL G;15/10/22;1;0;Almost an hour now and we are still waiting here with lots of vacant table inside. Staff said we have to wait for the others even if they are not here for an hour already. This is the first time I experience this in a restaurant.
737;Graham-John Salvaterra;20/10/22;4;0;Excellent prices, rich meaty broth, excellent service, clean and tasteful ambiance, what more could one ask for (in a restaurant 😏)!
739;Joel Chan;30/10/22;5;0;We ordered the tan tan ramen, tonkotsu plus ramen, corn croquettes, and karaage. All were very good, one of the better ramen places in the area. Seating was relatively fast with 1 group in front of us around 1:30PM on a Sunday.
740;Nate;04/11/22;3;0;It's a chain so you can expect close to the same service and quality of food as other branches. 3/5 in total for the food and the service. The food is pretty good for the low price. 5/5 for the food. The staff that served my party at this location weren't very attentive and failed to provide us with eating utensils after serving us food until they were waved down. The staff also did not check up on us at all during our meal and we needed to wave them down again just to get the bill. 1/5 for the staff.
741;Clara Regina;06/11/22;1;4;The flavour and soup is really good, however this location deserves a 1 star due to the amount of soup I got. I came here for lunch today and ordered the black tonkotsu. When I started eating the amount of soup I got was very little compared to the amount I got last time. WHAT A JOKE. For $19, ENSURE quality control of your portions 😡😡. That’s how you loose customers.
743;Shayn Yoe;13/11/22;5;1;The broth and noodles were delicious!  I went with the classic tonkatsu and it didn't disappoint. Kadaema options are available. But the service was outstanding. As an example, when my opened beer wasn't cold enough, they didn't think twice to replace it with a new one. Its a small restaurant but I definitely recommend a visit.
745;CHAN CHAN;20/11/22;2;0;Had lunch there today 2-3pm and overall not a good dining experience: 1. There are a lot of waiters but most of them are roaming but not paying attention to clients need. 2. Waiters even play with each other while totally forgot to provide us utensils 3. They took orders without using a pen so totally forgot what we ordered.
746;Jonica Ilagan;22/11/22;5;1;Staff was super friendly and ramen was really good!
748;Zak;03/12/22;5;0;Didn't expect food to be that good at a mall
749;Nyan Pasu;10/12/22;1;2;(Translated by Google) Unpalatable and expensive, no service and tip. Ajisen kington and Kenzo farther away are both cheaper, run away friends. The service is also extremely poor. When the store is not busy, there are four idle waiters who never take the initiative to serve. They don't move at all unless the customers call. You come to work just to chat in a daze? Very speechless 😓
751;JJ L;13/12/22;4;0;Dined here once during opening and once years later. This review is based on recent/years later experience. I ordered a Tonkotsu Ramen, it was really good yet light which I am a fan of. The meat slices were not too thick but it was fatty and it melted in my mouth along with the broth. The soft boiled egg was just right and it was runny and delicious. I would recommend coming here either in pairs or solo as big groups might find themselves feeling a bit squished. I did take a star away from service as no one informed me the menu was all digital now but that seems the norm now in most dine-in locations. They also didn't have the corn croquettes available and there was no indication this was the case. The server was nonetheless helpful when I asked for recommendations. Would come back here again for lunch in the future.
753;Amy;20/12/22;5;0;Soo good! Black garlic tonkotsu ramen was so flavourful and filling. Been looking for good ramen spots in Mississauga, and didn’t even know this place existed tucked inside Square One but it’s definitely my new go-to ramen spot. A tad bit pricier than other places but still worth it. Server was super friendly.
755;Abhilasha Dewan;29/12/22;1;0;No vegetarian broth at all? Can’t even make one for someone requesting it as their broth is pre-made? Seriously never heard of a punishment where a vegetarian has to eat ramen without any broth as they don’t have the option of a vegetarian broth!
756;Jen;02/01/23;4;0;One of my fav ramen spots! I especially love the tonkotsu black which comes with the garlic oil and the thick noodles are cooked perfectly with a chewy texture. However, there could be a wait since this is a small spot and also the cleanliness of the tables could be improved.
758;Vi;06/01/23;1;1;I have dined at this restaurant multiple times but I am extremely disappointed in this locations' service and the takeout that I received. Spent around $20 for what resembled cup noodles with egg and meat. The portion size was not the same as dining in :(
759;Eddy Shamshuddin;06/01/23;4;0;Food is excellent, the space is too cramped and very uncomfortable, best to get the food to go
761;Q;13/01/23;5;1;Very delicious ramen, reminds me of Ichiran in Japan. Much better than the other competitors ramen chains around.
762;Adelin A;15/01/23;5;0;Real authentic feel, fast service. Great staff
763;Mai;15/01/23;5;0;Delicious ramen.
764;Ram N P;16/01/23;4;0;Tasty and delicious foods.
765;Chris D;24/01/23;1;1;This establishment needs to readjust their prices, Kinton Ramen and Kamen Ramen are 2-3 km's away and serve good ramen but $5 less and a bigger menu
767;writesh ghosh;26/01/23;5;0;Me and my wife went here for dinner one snowy blustery evening and ordered a bowl of the Tonkotsu black ramen and the Miso black ramen along with a bottle of the peach sake. Both bowls of ramen were super fresh and amazingly flavorful, really packed a punch. We loved them and honestly feel these folks make some of the best ramen in town. Prices similar to some of the other popular chains(maybe a couple of extra dollars per bowl) but quality freshness wise way better than others. Highly recommended! The peach sake can be missed tbh!
768;Denny Wijaya;27/01/23;5;0;So worth the price. We ordered simple set, which is shoyu ramen with bamboo shoot and chasiu don. We also had tonkotsu ramen, gyoza and zangi (deep fried chicken like karaage). The soup of the ramen was good, not that thick which we like and the noodle was tasty. The kids loved the zangi and the chasiu on top of the rice from the simple set. They are so tender and tasty. Overall, so worth the price and we would return here for sure. So, on the second trip, we had black ramen (regular tonkotsu ramen added with black garlic sauce) and tantan (spicy) ramen. I prefer the regular tonkotsu though even though the ones we ordered on the 2nd trip were also nice.
769;Manwai Yau;29/01/23;1;0;Very very bad experiences. The server at the reception listen to our phone number wrongly and ask us to resented the waitlist, which is very very unacceptable. It is totally the restaurant’s fault and we were very unhappy for the response at the front desk. Will never come ever again, very disappointing  very sad and very hungry.
772;Sonja Jones;10/02/23;4;0;All around good
773;Cait Boer;14/02/23;5;0;I went today for lunch it was my first time at this location. I've been to the one in Toronto a few times. They have the best ramen I've ever tasted. I usually get the miso black but today I had the tonkotsu. I am always in heaven when I taste the broth for the first time at this restaurant. I highly recommend.
775;Clarisse Aza;17/02/23;5;2;The ramen here is rich and flavourful. I highly recommend the miso black or the vegetarian mazemen
776;Rahul Shetty;17/02/23;5;0;My first Ramen experience in Toronto and they got a permanent customer in me. The spicy ones are top notch.
778;Eric Dirauso;18/02/23;5;0;Absolutely Stellar ramen and great service, A must eat at joint!
779;S L;19/02/23;1;0;Too salty, too small portions, poor service
780;Praneeth;19/02/23;4;0;I've tried the vegetarian ramen and it was pretty good. Although i felt the quantity was less for the price we pay.
781;Michael Liman;19/02/23;4;2;The ramen is good, and tasty.  We ordered spicy Tantan and black ramen, sangi, gyoza. I taste the ramen rather salty. I believe if the ramen can be made less salty, the taste will be superb. No line-up.
783;Lena He;22/02/23;1;0;This place has too much preservatives put in their soup or sauce base. After dinning in here I’ve got the stomach flu, something was definitely not clean from their food. Stay away from this ramen place if you want to stay healthy!
784;Kevin S;07/03/23;5;0;A phenomenal ramen place! The broth, noodles, and prok chashu are delicious  great quality, and decently priced. There's not a whole lot of seating though, but it wasn't too busy when we went. We walked in and really didn't have to wait long. Only giving 4 stars for foos because there are some incredible ramen places West coast. So whole the food was amazing, can't say it was the best Ramen I've had... bur certainly a local favourite of mine.
787;Brian Do;12/03/23;5;1;The server Khanh was so cute and handsome. She was keeping track of my table like an obsessed stalker. Definitely made my night. I felt taken care of like a mama to a new born baby. Best experience I’ve had in decades. I will be coming back. Sally was making me feel like royalty, she gassed me up so much I thought she had a crush on me. Jinny was a goddess, I felt like I was serving her not her serve me. I was blessed with her presence. Brian was spicy
788;William N;14/03/23;4;0;Got the miso black and gyoza. Was about a 20 minute wait for 1 person but very worth it!!
790;Claire Chen;18/03/23;4;0;Best ramen in the square one area.
791;Ajay K;18/03/23;3;0;Good food! Staff confusing about Amex
792;William Heayn;19/03/23;5;0;This was the best bowl of tonkotsu ramen I've ever had! And the price is excellent!
794;Albert Florentin;30/03/23;5;0;always a pleasure eating here! shoutout to all the beautiful people here! marvelous service! thats why i keep coming back!
796;S5 travellers;02/04/23;4;0;Delicious tonkotsu ramen. Missed its entrance as it was not seen from inside the mall and there was no sign, needed to go through the automatic door then saw the entrance. Staff was nice.
797;Joss C;04/04/23;2;0;This Ramen cannot compare to Ajisen Ramen, and is more expensive. I was disappointed in taste, left no umami, or cravings to return for. Still left with Kamen Ramen in Mississauga.
798;Vassili;07/04/23;2;0;Went to try this place because Kenzo is closed on Sundays (our go to). Not sure if this is more authentic and I am not used it but we did not enjoy it at all. Very salty, flavour is basically guided exclusively by sodium. We tried the Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu+ as well as the gyoza and fried chicken. We found tonkotsu very salty and lacking in flavor, only ate half. Gyoza was decent but ratio of filling to dough was poor. Fried chicken was decent, hard to get this wrong I guess. Ended up paying around $70 with tip, definitely not worth it in my opinion. Only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the service was great, very polite and quick.
799;Mark Wong;09/04/23;3;0;Its quite salty today. Was not like that before :(
801;An 000;12/04/23;1;1;Was eating and the waitress cleaning the table beside me sprayed the disinfectant towards me and onto my food? Could’ve sprayed the other way no?
802;David Nezam;15/04/23;5;0;The new Tonkotsu Plus ramen is delicious!
803;ahmed qasim88;16/04/23;5;0;Good place and good restaurant 🥰🥰
804;Richard D;16/04/23;4;0;Bit on the pricy side and variations are few Miso black soup was very nice. I think there are better spots out there
